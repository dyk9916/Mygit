A note to young investors (or new investors),"As the Fed caused a bit of a ripple in the market today and I considered vacating a position (but ultimately didn't).  I thought a little bit about my journey over the years and thought I'd share a story and a few things I've learned.

Back in 2003, I made my first move in the stock market by taking an $1800 tax return and buying 200 shares of a coal company called Consol.  At the time it traded under the symbol CNX.  I bought it with almost no DD simply because it paid a pretty good dividend.  (Around .50/share if I recall correctly.)  This is back when internet trading really wasn't a thing.  I bought it through my bank and the trade cost me **$40**!  (I actually had to call a broker at my bank and place the trade over the phone.  Ancient times, right?)  lol  I figured, win lose or draw, eventually this stock will pay for itself with the dividend.  I didn't follow the market much after that because I was really holding for the dividend, but realized a couple of years later, it had climbed into the 30s.  Around 2007 it had hit 55 and I decided to sell.  Still with my bank, the trade cost me another forty bucks!  I took the money and put it in a basic savings account where it basically sat doing nothing until 2016.  (I missed the crash of 08, by being liquid at the time, but this was pure luck.  Nobody saw that coming.)

In 2016, after some reading I decided I had more confidence in trading so I took the money and opened an investor's checking/trading account with Charles Schwab.  *I was amazed at trades costing $4.99 and done on my laptop*!  lol  After quite a bit of DD I decided to buy 300 shares of NVIDIA.  At around $24 a share, it cost me about $7200.  (I took the rest and made a down payment on a new (*used*) car and an AK-47.)  lol...

After that, I just held the stock.  Diamond handed it as the kids say.  I've bought and sold quite a few other stocks over the years, but those two trades are where I started.  Two trades over the course of 17 years turned an $1800 tax return into a nice safety net worth over $200,000 with almost no effort on my part.

What have I learned?

Even a small amount of money in the stock market can lead to a big return.  But don't invest more than you can afford.  For me, a tax return one year was about all I could throw at it in my 20s.  ""YOLOing"" your rent check is never a good idea.

Be PATIENT.  You're not going to get rich overnight.  That type of thing is rare and risky.  Do your DD and hold onto what you're confident in.

When the market takes a downturn, **BUY!**  One of my biggest regrets is not investing heavily in 2008 when I was very liquid and the market had taken a nose dive.  I did not repeat this mistake last April/May when the pandemic caused another crash.  I bought everything I could.  Particularly old giants like Ford, and GE which were no brainer bargains at >$5.  The worst thing you can do is panic sell.  The market will come back.  Hold on and accumulate.  (I actually figured it might take 2 years for a comeback this time, but we bounced back much earlier.)  This thinking is what got me to hold the position I was thinking of bailing on today, when I realized I would just be panic selling in advance of some Fed news.  Regardless of the news, the market would bounce back.

Never let savings sit in a traditional savings account. (*like I did for 8 years from 2007-2016...lol)*  Even if compound interest is all you're after, there are much better rates with other financial products.

Be patient, *but don't be afraid to take profits*.  Don't fall in love.  Have an exit plan.  I sold Consol around 55 with a 9 entry.  Pretty good...  Later that same year, it climbed into the 90s.  Made me wince, but I didn't regret it.  *Unless you have a crystal ball, you're never going to enter at a historic low and exit at an all time high and that's ok.*  I realized at the time that coal was cyclical and was most likely going to decline in value in the coming years.  I stuck to the plan.  When I saw a spike, I sold.  For perspective, that high in the 90s in 08 hasn't been repeated since.  Consol trades in the high teens now and offers no dividend. (New ticker CEIX)  So in hindight I exited on a bubble that could have been better, but if I waited too long, it could have been much worse.

It's never too late to start.  If you look at those two simple trades over the span of 17 years, you could potentially do the same thing in your late 40s with a small amount of money (*remember nothing you can't afford to lose)* and have a decent nest egg by the time you hit 100% retirement in your 60s.

I hope to have given a little insight here.  I thought it was worth sharing.  If you disagree, don't be too hard on me.  I'm not a financial professional...  :D

Have a good'un!"
To all of you who are red this year while the S&P500 is up 30%,"Lately I keep hearing the same old narrative from beat-down investors on r/stocks who are down YTD even when SPY is up 30%: ""everything is down this year, the indexes are just being propped up by mega-cap tech companies like AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOGL, and NVDA"".  They go on to say that just because they are down this year and indexes are up, it's actually not that bad because the mega-caps are hiding the true state of the market.

Well, let's look at the data shall we...

Here are the YTD gains of a whole bunch of indexes from all the industries that I could think of, most of which don't have many of the aforementioned mega-caps in it:

VGT: +32.99% (Technology)  
XLF: +34.87% (Financial)  
XLE: +47.15% (Energy)  
XLI: +22.38& (Industrials)  
XLV: +24.99% (Healthcare)  
DBC: +43.37% (Commodities)  
PAVE: +37.90% (Infrastructure)  
AVUV: +42.18 (Small Cap Value)  
SCHD: +27.87% (Dividends)  
SMH: +43.21% (Semiconductors)  
ITA: +13.16% (Aerospace and Defense)  
TRVL: +6.82% (Travel)

As can be seen, every major sector of the market is green for the year.  Even travel and aerospace, two of the hardest hit sectors, are up YTD.  Every single other sector is up at least 20%.  It would take an objectively bad investment plan to pick only losers out of this sea of green.

So can we please stop with the BS that a handful of companies are propping up a dying market.  If you are down this year, you really need to review your investing decisions because you are almost certainly investing in companies with poor fundamentals that have been driven entirely by hype and/or trading options in a way that is pure gambling.  I just hope that you are taking the right lessons away from this year.  Please consider putting the majority of your money into broad market index funds.

Wishing everyone a successful 2022!"
Pelosi's husband buying over $1 million of computer chip stock ahead of vote,"[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/cnn-msnbc-abc-cbs-nbc-ignore-pelosis-husband-buying-over-dollar1-million-of-computer-chip-stock-ahead-of-vote/ar-AAZKFKr?li=BBnb7Kz)

Paul Pelosi, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, made a stock purchase of over $1 million in a computer chip company just weeks before a potential vote in Congress which would give a massive subsidy to the industry. 

 Mr. Pelosi made a purchase of between $1 million and $5 million [shares of Nvidia](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/stocks), a semiconductor company, according to a disclosure filing made by Speaker Pelosi's office. He exercised 200 call options, or 20,000 shares, the disclosure states. The disclosure raised eyebrows, as Reuters reported that the Senate could vote on a bill that contains billions of dollars in subsidies within the semiconductor industry as early as Tuesday. 

Curtis Houck, managing editor of right-leaning media watchdog NewsBusters, said it was ""no accident that the liberal media have made the decision to ignore"" the story that could damage Pelosi. 

""For those that are aware of it, they have zero comprehension and/or shame to realize how it's a quintessential story of how the elites work for their own financial benefit, not that of the American people,"" Houck told Fox News Digital. 

Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi's office has attempted to distance the House Speaker from her husband’s recent stock trades. 

""The Speaker does not own any stocks. As you can see from the required disclosures, with which the Speaker fully cooperates, these transactions are marked ‘SP’ for Spouse. The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions,"" spokesman Drew Hammill told FOX Business. 

In 2020, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, N.C., and other high-profile lawmakers came under fire for stock sales in the run-up to the COVID-19 pandemic that were suspected to have been made based on confidential information about the pending outbreak. CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and NBC all covered the story. ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" even featured a lengthy commentary about it. 

 Charlie Gasparino appeared on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Monday to discuss whether the move could be insider trading. 

""This dude is a rising star on Wall Street,"" Gasparino joked before taking a serious tone. 

""Obviously this brings up the notion, is this insider trading? Is she giving him some tips? We should point out that the SEC and the DOJ have brought cases on insider tips via pillow talk. Trust me on this. It’s happened,"" he said. ""I don’t believe this hits the insider trading bar… a lot of information about this legislation was bouncing around, it has to be material, non-public, stolen, misappropriated. It kind of doesn’t hit those barriers. But what this does hit is limousine liberalism, arrogance on steroids."" "
Beware of what AMC shorts are holding!,"I understand that most people in this thread invest safely and aren't willing to risk their money on a risky play like a short squeeze.

However, I would recommend to everyone to at least acknowledge that a short squeeze is potentially happening, and could potentially continue to happen. What this means is you should be weary of which Hedge Funds are shorting AMC at the moment, AND WHAT THEIR LONG POSITIONS ARE.

If AMC or GME begin to cause Hedge Funds to get margin called and liquidated, we might be in for a flash crash of some of the biggest named stocks.

**TL;DR:** Blackberry ($BB) is almost daily announcing new partnerships and new clients for their software, including new deals with companies that are just now or just this year launching autonomous vehicles that run on QNX software. The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY

**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market

###**FAQs:**

**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**

**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.

**2) Should I invest now or later?**

**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP

**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**

**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.

**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**

**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.

#**Blackberry Analysis Regarding Infotainment and Google and Ford Deal:**

see ""Blackberry (BB) Stock News Analysis | What I need to say..."" by Financial Live by LEYA on the forbidden video website

--> The media recently picked out a story that left out a lot of pertinent information, making it seems that BB lost Ford as a client. This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX

#**Facebook Settlement with BB**

[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)

This is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents. They settled in February, and the day that the settlement was finalized, John Chen (BB CEO) tweeted reminding everyone that BB is used on the ISS

https://twitter.com/JohnChen/status/1358853064153784321?s=20

Well, the connection and speculation here is that Blackberry is going to the moon, and that the settlement is rather significant. Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.

#**Blackberry New Partnerships**

Within the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.

#**Rumor: Blackberry Buyout? Here's why that's not happening:**

Just read this post. It's quite revealing:

[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)

**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.

#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**

Alright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:

For one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.

As for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)

#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**

Blackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

#**Really, no competitors?**

Well it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.

#**Conclusion:**

All eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&LangLocaleID=1033&Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.

Initially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...

"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021","Good Sunday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021.

# **Stronger economic data could power stocks that thrive in a rebound in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stronger-economic-data-could-power-stocks-that-thrive-in-a-rebound-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.
*****
> In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.
*****
> While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound – financials, airlines and industrials – stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.
*****
> Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.
*****
> The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.
*****
> He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.
*****
> “He’s going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. “It is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.”
*****
> But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.
*****
> # Improving forecasts
> Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.
*****
> Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.
*****
> The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.
*****
> ″[Powell’s] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He’s going to be supportive of the administration’s effort to get a big package through,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
*****
> # Key data during the week
> Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy’s and TJX.
*****
> Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday
*****
> The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.
*****
> “I think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.
*****
> He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.
*****
> “I think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,” he said.
*****
> “The caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that’s going to go away sooner than we think,” Keon said. “Right now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That’s also due to the fact we’re likely to get a big stimulus package.”
*****
> He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.
*****
> “I think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We’re still bullish. We’re still overweight stocks,” Keon said.
*****
> He said a flood of money could hit the economy.
*****
> “The size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,” Keon added. “Households now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.”
*****
> He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. “You’re going to see an incredible boom.”

> # Value Outperforming Growth But Only for Large Caps

> While the S&P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-DVY.png))**

> Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**

> Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).

> # Industrial Metals Shining Bright

> While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals—as proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index—are up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**

> Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-3.png))**

> Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains. As shown in the charts below, both year to date and over the past year, these three metals have risen the most with tin in the number one spot in both respects.

> # One Year Later: 3 Lessons Learned Since the Market Peak

> “Bulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.” Old Wall Street saying.

> Today marks one year since the market began to price in the effects that COVID-19 would have on the world. The old market adage “stairs up, elevator down” certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.

> The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn’t looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?

> **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it’s difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.

> **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in “stay at home” themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. “It’s our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,” noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Drawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.” If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year’s volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.

> Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

> # Stimulus Matters: Retail Sales Rebound Big in January

> The US economy had a tumultuous year in 2020, to say the least, and after rebounding strongly in the third quarter, the holiday surge in COVID-19 cases increased the risk that the economy may stumble heading into the new year. The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.

> Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December—ordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales—consumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau—the most in seven months—and greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.

> Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**

> “Fiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.”

> Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January’s retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn’t receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.

> Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4–4.5% to 5–5.5%. Yesterday’s retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target—and may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.

> However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden’s fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.

> # Tech Leading in New Highs

> The S&P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**

> On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.

> # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead

> One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**

> We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.

> # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?

> Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.

> This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.

> We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks."
My 8 investing guidelines.,"I've been investing, trading, gambling for about 5 years now and I've done pretty much every rookie mistake there is. Sold winners from 2016 (Shop,Nvidia,AMD,Paypal) Lost fortunes on chasing that pennystock. Played and lost with trying to time the market, option trading. 

&#x200B;

I've been very active during these years reading and learning and you be surprised how often people get sucked in to the same stuff you self did once. 

These are 8 guidelines that really helps me and that I've learn to appreciate over the years.

&#x200B;

**1.Don't FOMO**

Yes we all heard it. You know that feeling when people are posting crazy gains on these new stocks, we all saw the EV hype. It's so so easy to get sucked in to thinking, if I just put in some money right now I can get 10-20-50% gains in a few days! It's already up 200% this month, surely it will keep going!? 

This takes some real patience to keep your head cool and realize it could very well be overbought and the downside risk is just a lot higher than potential. 

&#x200B;

I've seen several sector hypes. We all remember the crypto bubble, the weed bubble and now lately the EV bubble. They all come and go and the more of these you been in from the start the easier it is to realize what's going on. 

&#x200B;

**2. Cut your losers and let your winners run**

Buying the dip is great when the market is down but if the fundamentals of the business is bad then usually this will just result in greater loss. On the flipside, if you have a few great picks and nothing fundamentally has changed and it keeps moving in the right direction then don't be afarid to keep adding.

&#x200B;

**3. When the overall market is down, you buy**

No one can predict the market, don't waste time on it. When the overall market is down your stock is literally on sale. Usually every sector is down when the market is down, your stock and business has not changed one bit however, it's just a lower price now. 

&#x200B;

**4. Don't be afraid of corrections.**

Yeah it sucks seeing your portfolio down 20-30-40% but realize that stocks always go up, they seriously always do. Just keep your head down, keep buying and play that long game.

**5. Small amounts can turn into big profits down the line**

When you get really into investing you seriously start rethinking your life. That new OLED 77 inch? Only 2k right? What do you think that 2000 could be in 10 years? You just want to put every damn penny you got in the stock market because compounding interests are just too good to pass up. So just rethink if really need that new thing now or if it could wait.

**6. If the company keeps growing, why sell?**

Taking profit is good however not always the best thing to do. If the stock you have keeps growing and keeps crushing earnings. Why should you sell? Why just not keep it for years, it sure can be tempting but are you sure that money could be spent better elsewhere when it's easily growing in your winning stock.

&#x200B;

**7, Never regret that you didn't buy more**

 We all been here. Why the hell didn't I buy more of Amazon? Why didn't I just put my whole paycheck in this stock!? 

You can never do this. It won't lead to anything, you can't fix it and you honestly did the best decisions at the time with the information you had. Realize that at the time this was the best decision, ofcourse hindsight it looks like you could have done a better decision.

&#x200B;

**8. Don't sell and buy in again to time a correction**

This is very hard and with the momentum some growth stocks have these days you might just end up loosing more of that profit even if there is a slight correction. Just keep the money in and stop worrying."
I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolution,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)
* Semi-conductors
* Biotechnology / Healthcare
* IoT manufacturing
* Renewable energy
* Manufacturing / Mining

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.
   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data.
      * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity.
      * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But as @[ArtakhaPrime](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArtakhaPrime/) mentioned: Amazon and Microsoft ""are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.""
   * **Amazon - $AMZN**
   * **Microsoft - $MSFT**
   * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category**
   * **Fastly - $FSLY - Need DD**
   * **Digital Ocean - $DOCN - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Advanced Robotics / automation**
   * **Teradyne - $TER**
      * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing. Customers are Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. **Some of their business units are:**
      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.
      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.
   * **Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD**
   * **ABB - $ABB - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

There is obviously a massive need for these resources going forward and MP is the only chance the US has of competing with China in this demand. Of course, China operates in a market condition where they can exploit working conditions and the workforce in ways that American companies cannot, and MP claims to engage in their mining activity sustainably. Noting that MP (Mountian Pass) Mine is in California, we can assume they are doing their best to remain in compliance with a green energy future. MP NET INCOME Q4 2019: 1M MP NET INCOME Q4 2020: 24M

Britain blocks Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard,"LONDON — Britain’s top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block[ Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)’s acquisition of video game publisher [Activision Blizzard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ATVI/).

The  measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to  convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition.

Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision.

The  U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as  it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market.

Microsoft  could make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform,  Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the  space, the CMA said.

Cloud gaming is a technology that enables  gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers — effectively  streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is  still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a  mainstream way of playing games.

Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in [one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-buy-activision.html) to date.

Executives  at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the  acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative  franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content  offerings.

However, some of Microsoft’s competitors contested the  deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion  games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision’s popular Call of Duty franchise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/microsoft-is-growing-tired-of-sonys-call-of-duty-complaints/?sh=bd568595ebb9) for certain platforms.

[Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP/), in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft’s Activision purchase.  The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty  exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run. 

 Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)

and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.

Microsoft  argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.

Microsoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.

The CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.

Cloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.

Even with the CMA’s blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal. The EU [continues to probe the merger](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html) to assess whether it hurts competition, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission [sued to block the deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-game-giant-activision-blizzard.html) on antitrust grounds. Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)

and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.

Sharing my top companies with you.,"I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it.

It's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.

**- ALPHABET -A-.** Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks.

**- ARISTA NETWORKS.** Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.

**- FACEBOOK.** This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy.

**- GALAPAGOS.** To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences.

**- INCYTE GENOMICS.** Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%

**- LULULEMON ATHLETICA.** Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase.

**- MASTERCARD.** Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.

**- MICROSOFT.** No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices.

**- NVIDIA.** Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars.

**- VEEVA SYSTEMS.** One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.

One last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.

Hope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!

TL;DR. Stonks only go up."

"Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company","Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It’s the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker’s stock soaring.

Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google’s $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.

The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.

Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.

Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques — such as transformer architecture — used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.

Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a “code red” situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.

Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

Nine US governors press U.S. lawmakers to pass 52 Billion semiconductor funding bill. Taiwan unreliable potentially trillions at risk.,">https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-bipartisan-governors-urge-congress-to-pass-chips-act-to-create-american-jobs-boost-semiconductor-production/

So far the shortage has cost 2.2 Million vehicles. That could just be a tiny fraction if Taiwan has more serious future issues such as natural disasters or China invasion, which could cost businesses TRILLIONS in damages to companies such as:  Ford (F) , General Motors (GM) , and Toyota (TM), Dell Technologies (DELL),  Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), AMD, NVDA, and many more.


>The group, which also includes the governors of auto-producing states like Alabama, said the shortage had cost automakers 2.2 million vehicles and affected 575,000 jobs in the industry.

>The semiconductor funding passed the U.S. Senate earlier this year by 68-32 as part of the broader U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, or USICA. But it has not passed the House of Representatives.

Investing in ETFs,"A couple of weeks ago, I posted a comment in response to a question about ETFs. This question comes up very often; usually two or three times a week. Maybe more than that.  Several people suggested that it be ""pinned.""  I obviously cannot do that, however if a mod wants to pin this, feel free to do so.  I did make a few modifications and additions to that comment and for those who haven't gone back to see the changes, I thought I'd post it again here.  Hopefully, this helps people who are interested in an investing approach that is either made up of ETFs or that includes ETFs as a part of their portfolio.

**QQQ** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).

**VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VGT**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.

**IWF** \- This is a Russell 1000 Growth fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. Other funds that use the Russell 1000 Growth Index include **RWGV** and **VONG**. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.  **VONE** and **IWB** use the Russell 1000 Index as their benchmark.  **SPYG** and **VOOG** use the S&P 500 Growth Index for their benchmark and would be similar (but not identical) to **IWF**, **VONG** and **RWGV**.

**IWM** \- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.

**VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.

**EEM** \- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://jd.com/), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.

**EFA** \- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca.

**S*****ector fund ETFs:***

**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.

**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.

* **ARKG** \- Genomic Revolution
* **ARKF** \- Fintech
* **ARKK** \- Disruptive Companies (broader market)
* **ARKW** \- Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)
* **ARKQ** \- Robotics and artificial intelligence
* **PRNT** \- 3D printing technology
* **IZRL** \- disruptive companies based in Israel

**XL series of funds**. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:

* **XLV** \- Health Care
* **XLK** \- Technology
* **XLY** \- Consumer Discretionary
* **XLF** \- Financial
* **XLU** \- Utilities
* **XLE** \- Energy
* **XLB** \- Materials
* **XLC** \- Communications
* **XLG** \- S&P Top 50
* **XLI** \- Industrial
* **XLP** \- Consumer Staples
* **XLRE** \- Real Estate

**CLOUD COMPUTING:** **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.

Nvidia reports 122% revenue growth on surging demand for data center chips,"Nvidia reported earnings after the bell that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and guidance, and provided stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.

Nvidia shares fell nearly 4% in extended trading.

Here are the results.

Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted versus 64 cents per share expected by LSEG.

Revenue: $30.04 billion versus $28.7 billion expected by LSEG.

Nvidia said it expected about $32.5 billion in current quarter revenue, versus $31.77 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Nvidia is the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom. Its market value has expanded more than nine times since the end of 2022 and was up 34% since the company’s last earnings report.  

Nvidia said it approved $50 billion in share buybacks.

Cathie Wood's ARK Invest sold most of its Nvidia stake just before the chipmaker kicked off a rally that added $585 billion in market value,"Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is probably wishing it didn't sell nearly 1 million shares of Nvidia between early October and today following the chipmaker's massive year-to-date surge of more than 160%.

Nvidia stock soared as much as 30% on Thursday after the company announced jaw-dropping guidance as it benefits from a wave of demand for its chipsets that support generative AI technology platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard.

But the active investment manager, who has owned Nvidia on and off since the flagship fund's inception in 2014, missed out on massive gains as it started to pare down its position in Nvidia heading into a 52-week low in mid-October.

Since Ark Invest's first sale on October 5, when it held 1.3 million shares of Nvidia across all of its ETFs, the stock has soared 190% and added $620 billion to its market value. By late November, Nvidia owned just over 500,000 shares of the company.

Today, Ark Invest holds just 390,000 shares across its suite of next-generation technology ETFs. The stock is not in its flagship Disruptive Innovation fund.

Rough calculations by Insider suggest Ark Invest left more than $200 million in potential profits on the table when it sold down its Nvidia stake throughout the end of last year. 

Ark's ill-timed share sale of Nvidia highlights the difficulties of actively managing a portfolio of disruption-focused investments, because even if you pick the right theme to invest in, there's no guarantee you'll pick the right companies to bet on.

**In February, Wood said Ark's wave of Nvidia sales was in part because its valuation was ""very high"" and that it was consolidating its portfolio into higher conviction names.**

""We like Nvidia, we think it's going to be a good stock. It's priced, it's the 'check-the-box' AI company. For a flagship fund, where we're consolidated towards our highest conviction names, part of that has to do with the valuation,"" she told CNBC on February 27.

Wood is instead counting on UiPath for Ark Invest's exposure to artificial intelligence, which is its second largest position across all of its ETFs. Meanwhile, Tesla remains Ark Invest's top holding, which is also working on artificial intelligence to help enable its self-driving technology. 

But despite the hype in AI this year, those two stocks have only captured some of the year-to-date gains seen across the space. Shares of UIPath are up just 14% year-to-date, while Tesla stock is up an impressive 50%. 

Shares of Ark Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF were down 2.7% on Thursday, despite the Nasdaq 100 jumping 1.7%.

"EU approves Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, clearing major hurdle","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/15/microsoft-activision-deal-eu-approves-takeover-of-call-of-duty-maker.html

European Union regulators on Monday approved Microsoft’s proposed $69 billion acquisition of gaming firm Activision Blizzard, subject to remedies offered by the U.S. tech giant. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said that Microsoft offered remedies in the nascent area of cloud gaming that have staved off antitrust concerns. These remedies centered on allowing users to stream Activision games they purchase on any cloud streaming platform. Europe’s green light is a huge win for Microsoft, after the U.K.’s top competition authority last month blocked the deal. Regulators globally have been probing whether Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision could distort competition in the console and cloud gaming market. One area regulators questioned is whether Microsoft might take Activision games and keep them exclusively on the U.S. giant’s own platforms. Activision is behind some of the biggest console and PC games in the world, including the Call of Duty franchise and World of Warcraft.

The EU decision comes after the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority last month blocked the deal over concerns that it would reduce competition in the nascent cloud gaming market. The CMA said that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision’s key games, such as Call of Duty, exclusive to its own cloud gaming platforms. The CMA nevertheless said the acquisition would not reduce competition in the console market.

Microsoft has faced opposition to the deal from regulators and some of its rivals, including PlayStation games console maker Sony. Microsoft sought to allay the Commission’s concerns over making Activision games exclusive ahead of the EU decision. Microsoft President Brad Smith met with EU officials in February, after which the tech giant said it would bring Xbox PC games to Nvidia’s cloud gaming service. The chipmaker had reportedly expressed opposition to the acquisition takeover. Microsoft also signed a 10-year deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to the Japanese gaming giant’s platforms, if the Activison deal closes."
"How I applied Buffet's strategies to my own portfolio, +70% networth, beat SP500 by 40%","I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~65% since its lowest point in March, [~350k to 620k](https://imgur.com/a/3Vu6u2f). 20k from the car I bought in March. I rolled over a 401k and it messed up Mint's reporting, hence the spike from Jul -> Aug. 

I beat the [SP500 by 40%](https://imgur.com/a/adeDokD) in my YOLO account, my FAANG account went from [180->300](https://imgur.com/a/kBmBp1O)

I did this by following some basic investing principles, buying and holding for the most part, being patient, and only investing in areas which I have expertise in. 

I did not buy into the TSLA hype, nor do I play options, nor do I play crypto. 

#High level advice:
=========================================

I picked the 7 I agree with.

1. Invest in what you know…and nothing more.
2. Never compromise on business quality
3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever
4. Diversification can be dangerous
5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)
8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)
10. Only listen to those you know and trust 

I firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  

#General mindset:
================
- Keep emotions out of the market
- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.
- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. 
- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. 
- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)
- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. 

#Application:
==================================================================
I was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. 

As a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. 

Based on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good ""feel"" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). 

I tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. 

Post COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.

My hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. 

1. eCommerce + AdTech 
2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)
3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)

These are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:

1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?
2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?
3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? 
4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?
5. Who are their customers and target demographic?
6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.

In March, I took what I believe to be an ""educated gamble"". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.

*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. 

I have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.

Here are the non FAANGs I chose.

1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. 

2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.

3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. 

4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.

5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. 

6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.

7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. ""Zoom parties"" and ""Zoom dates"" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.

8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. 

10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.

11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. 

12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. 

13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say ""Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?"" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.

14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.

Mutual funds/ETFs
1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. 

2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. 

3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... 

Titanvest:
I was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.

#Some things I do that that are against the grain:

- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.

- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.

- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. 

One example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. 

Lastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. 

Also, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision."
$FB officially worth less than $NVDA,"I know this sub is primarily focused on fundamentals and typically conservative, but there are some big bulls out there.

Can someone explain to me how $NVDA is not overvalued out the ass as every article I read see screams to buy $NVDA as it is a discount right now.

When I look at these companies, I do not understand how Nvidia could be priced where it is now. The two big areas of growth people seem to have for Nvidia is the self driving space and the metaverse. Self driving is years away from being viable and there are many players. Isn't metaverse the exact thing that has demolished $FB's market cap? How can you be bullish on one and bearish on the other for the exact same thing?

Earnings are next week and everything seems to scream this is going under. At the same time I am remembering that markets can remain irrational for longer than I can remain solvent.

I'm interested in hearing why this stock demands such a premium."
"US gov to Nvidia: 'If you redesign a chip that enables China to do AI, I'm going to control it the very next day'","So it looks like NVDA wouldn't be able to just continuously create slightly cut down versions of their products for the Chinese market in the future.

Quick Reminder: Many Stock youtubers have financial incentive to keep you watching daily so they steer you toward short term trades.,"If they told you invest in an index fund or buy and hold the best of FAANG+MSFT/NVDA. There would be no reason to watch their videos daily. Or their market open and close live streams. The views are how they make their money. Meet Kevin for example makes millions each month off the views.

So these financial youtubers talk about short term plays and high frequency trading so once one play is over you come back for the next. Or they talk about 5, 10, etc stocks they are buying each week.

Yes there is money made in swing/day trading there is also people who lose a lot of money and dont talk about it so you just here from the winners. Im just trying to say those youtubers arent there for long term advice. Some even do horrible stuff like have 50% of portfolio in TSLA or say they are buying options and will dump them into shares after the stock market has a rally that shouldnt be followed."

Nvidia passes Microsoft in market cap to become most valuable public company ,"Nvidia, long known in the niche gaming community for its graphics chips, is now the most valuable public company in the world.

Shares of the chipmaker climbed 3.2% in mid-day trading on Tuesday, lifting the company’s market cap to $3.33 trillion, surpassing Microsoft. Earlier this month, Nvidia hit a $3 trillion market cap for the first time, and passed Apple.

Nvidia shares are up more than 170% so far this year, and took a leg higher after the company reported first-quarter earnings in May. The stock has multiplied by more than nine-fold since the end of 2022, a rise that’s coincided with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence.

Nvidia has about 80% of the market for AI chips used in data centers, a business that’s ballooned as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and others have raced to snap up the processors needed to build AI models and run increasingly large workloads.

For the most recent quarter, revenue in Nvidia’s data center business rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, accounting for about 86% of the company’s total sales.

Founded in 1991, Nvidia spent its first few decades primarily as a hardware company that sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. It’s also dabbled in cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions.

But over the past two years, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street came to recognize the company’s technology as the engine behind an explosion in AI that shows no signs of slowing. The rally has lifted co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth to more than $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes.

Microsoft shares are up about 20% so far this year. The software giant has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, after it took a significant stake in OpenAI and integrated the startup’s AI models into its most important products, including Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Azure cloud service. The company just released a new generation of laptops that are designed to run its AI models, called Copilot+.

Nvidia is a newcomer to the title of most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have been trading the title.

Nvidia’s ascent has been so rapid that the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark of 30 stocks that’s historically included the most valuable U.S. companies. Alongside its earnings release last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect on Jan. 7.

The split gives Nvidia a better shot at being added to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher stock prices — rather than market caps — have outsized influence on the benchmark.

"1,5 Years Since My Journey Began, $52 591 dollars wealthier & only 18 months left.","*Introduction*

I'm 20 years old and my interest for the stock market began at age 16 which later grew into becoming my lovely addiction and before graduating high school i already had a detailed plan on how i would become financial independent and self employed as quick as possible, the first milestone to reach before continuing my dreams are to reach an entire net worth of $100 000 dollars.

In the beginning of setting the $100 000 dollar goal i started with $13 953 dollars and today 1,5 years later i have a total net worth of $66 544 dollars which basically means i only have 33,45% left of the goal to complete within 18 months which is entirely possible. It felt so much harder in the beginning but hard work pays off. While creating the plan i expected to have $52 730 dollars this month of the year but from making better decisions, working hard and presumably a little touch of luck i'm 5 months ahead.

I maximized the overtime-limit at my workplace last year which is roughly 200 hours per year, i managed to reach 212h, sadly the overtime is cancelled due to covid-19 but currently i have 24h 36m in overtime. I've driven taxi *(illegally which i stopped doing)*, been cutting lawns an lending out money in order to speed up the process of my journey.

I've cut almost all unnecessary expenses, i don't travel, i rarely drink alcohol, still driving around in my $1 000 dollar car watching others laugh at me but don't get me wrong, i enjoy traveling and eventfully i'm going to buy myself a new car, i don't want to create wealth just to stare at it. This is something i been planning for a very long time and that i'm fully committed to. It's psychologically frustrating but in the end it's definitely going to be worth it.

*Portfolio distribution*

* *Stocks: 35,79% ($23 816)*
* *Funds: 8,27% ($5 503)*

* *Funds:* **Avanza Auto 6, Avanza USA, Spiltan Aktiefond Investmentbolag**

note: *The Tickers with bold fonts are swedish stocks/funds which may not be available in your country.*

I sold a majority of my shares in the beginning of 2020 expecting a recession or correction but instead we got covid-19 which was extremely unpredictable so i was really lucky that i already had a pretty high amount in liquidity. So far i've been taking advantage of the pandemic by investing in stocks that i hopefully believe will recover. I also did some Q1 report trading which made me about $3 000 dollars profit, i traded CAST, GOOG, TWTR and I'm constantly looking for opportunities.

I'm expected to be fully invested within 1 year and i'm not stressed by having 55,93% liquidity since the inflation is 0. The *""fear of missing out""* is also nothing that's bothering me, everything can happen, especially now.

*Income, expenses & conditions*

My monthly income varies depending on how much i work but i averaged $3 008 dollars after taxes during 2019, i invest everything except $500 dollars and the reason how i can invest 83,37% of my monthly income is because i still live at home. The only reason why i still live at home is so i can take advantage of the opportunity to invest and build myself a foundation.

*The Missing piece*

What i'm missing is friends and connections with this interest in common, i rarely have anyone to talk with when it comes to investments and such so i really hope that i can reach out to some of you. If you're interested just send me a message, thanks for reading and if you have any questions i'll be happy to answer."

NVidia – Know What You Own,"How many people really understand what they’re buying, especially when it comes to highly specialized hardware companies? Most NVidia investors seem to be relying on a vague idea of how the company should thrive “in the future”, as their GPUs are ostensibly used for Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, holograms, etc. Having been shocked by how this company is represented in the media, I decided to lay out how this business works, doing my part to fight for reality. With what’s been going on in markets, I don’t like my chances but here goes:

Let’s start with…

**How does NVDA make money?**

NVDA is in the business of semiconductor design. As a simplified image in your head, you can imagine this as designing very detailed and elaborate posters. Their engineers create circuit patterns for printing onto semiconductor wafers. NVDA then pays a semiconductor foundry (the printer – generally TSMC) to create chips with those patterns on them.

Simply put, NVDA’s profits represent the difference between the price at which they can sell those chips, less the cost of printing, and less the cost of paying their engineers to design them.

Notably, after the foundry prints the chips, NVDA also has to pay (I say pay, but really it is more like “sell at a discount to”) their “add-in board” (AIB) partners to stick the chips onto printed circuit boards (what you might imagine as green things with a bunch of capacitors on them). That leads to the final form in which buyers experience the GPU.

**What is a GPU?**

NVDA designs chips called GPUs (Graphical Processing Units). Initially, GPUs were used for the rapid processing and creation of images, but their use cases have expanded over time. You may be familiar with the CPU (Central Processing Unit). CPUs sit at the core of a computer system, doing most of the calculation, taking orders from the operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux), etc. AMD and Intel make CPUs. GPUs assist the CPU with certain tasks. You can think of the CPU as having a few giant very powerful engines. The GPU has a lot of small much less powerful engines. Sometimes you have to do a lot of really simple tasks that don’t require powerful engines to complete. Here, the act of engaging the powerful engines is a waste of time, as you end up spending most of your time revving them up and revving them down. In that scenario, it helps the CPU to hand that task over to the GPU in order to “accelerate” the completion of the task. The GPU only revs up a small engine for each task, and is able to rev up all the small engines simultaneously to knock out a large number of these simple tasks at the same time. Remember the GPU has lots of engines. The GPU also has an edge in interfacing a lot with memory but let’s not get too technical.

**Who uses NVDA’s GPUs?**

There are two main broad end markets for NVDA’s GPUs – Gaming and Professional. Let’s dig into each one:

**The Gaming Market:**

A Bit of Ancient History (**Skip if impatient**)

GPUs were first heavily used for gaming in arcades. They then made their way to consoles, and finally PCs. NVDA started out in the PC phase of GPU gaming usage. They weren’t the first company in the space, but they made several good moves that ultimately led to a very strong market position. Firstly, they focused on selling into OEMs – guys like the equivalent of today’s DELL/HP/Lenovo – , which allowed a small company to get access to a big market without having to create a lot of relationships. Secondly, they focused on the design aspect of the GPU, and relied on their Asian supply chain to print the chip, to package the chip and to install in on a printed circuit board – the Asian supply chain ended up being the best in semis. But the insight that really let NVDA dominate was noticing that some GPU manufacturers were focusing on keeping hardware-accelerated Transform and Lighting as a Professional GPU feature. As a start-up, with no professional GPU business to disrupt, NVidia decided their best ticket into the big leagues was blowing up the market by including this professional grade feature into their gaming product. It worked – and this was a real masterstroke – the visual and performance improvements were extraordinary. 3DFX, the initial leader in PC gaming GPUs, was vanquished, and importantly it happened when funding markets shut down with the tech bubble bursting and after 3DFX made some large ill-advised acquisitions. Consequently 3DFX, went from hero to zero, and NVDA bought them for a pittance out of bankruptcy, acquiring the best IP portfolio in the industry.

**Some more Modern History**

This is what NVDA’s pure gaming card revenue looks like over time – NVDA only really broke these out in 2005 (note by pure, this means ex-Tegra revenues):

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr\_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno)

So what is the history here? Well, back in the late 90s when GPUs were first invented, they were **required** to play any 3D game. As discussed in the early history above, NVDA landed a hit product to start with early and got a strong burst of growth: revenues of 160M in 1998 went to 1900M in 2002. But then NVDA ran into strong competition from ATI (later purchased and currently owned by AMD). While NVDA’s sales struggled to stay flat from 2002 to 2004, ATI’s doubled from 1Bn to 2Bn. NVDA’s next major win came in 2006, with the 8000 series. ATI was late with a competing product, and NVDA’s sales skyrocketed – as can be seen in the graph above. With ATI being acquired by AMD they were unfocused for some time, and NVDA was able to keep their lead for an extended period. Sales slowed in 2008/2009 but that was due to the GFC – people don’t buy expensive GPU hardware in recessions.

And then we got to 2010 and the tide changed. Growth in desktop PCs ended. Here is a chart from Statista:

📷[https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr\_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9)

This resulted in two negative secular trends for Nvidia. Firstly, with the decline in popularity of desktop PCs, growth in gaming GPUs faded as well (below is a chart from Jon Peddie). Note that NVDA sells discrete GPUs, aka DT (Desktop) Discrete. Integrated GPUs are mainly made by Intel (these sit on the motherboard or with the CPU).

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr\_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h)

You can see from the chart above that discrete desktop GPU sales are fading faster than integrated GPU sales. This is the other secular trend hurting NVDA’s gaming business. Integrated GPUs are getting better and better, taking over a wider range of tasks that were previously the domain of the discrete GPU. Surprisingly, the most popular eSports game of recent times – Fortnite – only requires Intel HD 4000 graphics – an Integrated GPU from 2012!

So at this point you might go back to NVDA’s gaming sales, and ask the question: What happened in 2015? How is NVDA overcoming these secular trends?

The answer consists of a few parts.Firstly, AMD dropped the ball in 2015. As you can see in this chart, sourced from 3DCenter, AMD market share was halved in 2015, due to a particularly poor product line-up:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr\_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd)

Following this, NVDA came out with Pascal in 2016 – a very powerful offering in the mid to high end part of the GPU market. At the same time, AMD was focusing on rebuilding and had no compelling mid or high end offerings. AMD mainly focused on maintaining scale in the very low end. Following that came 2017 and 2018: AMD’s offering was still very poor at the time, but cryptomining drove demand for GPUs to new levels, and AMD’s GPUs were more compelling from a price-performance standpoint for crypto mining initially, perversely leading to AMD gaining share. NVDA quickly remedied that by improving their drivers to better mine crypto, regaining their relative positioning, and profiting in a big way from the crypto boom. Supply that was calibrated to meet gaming demand collided with cryptomining demand and Average Selling Prices of GPUs shot through the roof. Cryptominers bought top of the line GPUs aggressively.

A good way to see changes in crypto demand for GPUs is the mining profitability of Ethereum:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr\_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ)

This leads us to where we are today. 2019 saw gaming revenues drop for NVDA. Where are they likely to head?

The secular trends of falling desktop sales along with falling discrete GPU sales have reasserted themselves, as per the Jon Peddie research above. Cryptomining profitability has collapsed.

AMD has come out with a new architecture, NAVI, and the 5700XT – the first Iteration, competes effectively with NVDA in the mid-high end space on a price/performance basis. This is the first real competition from AMD since 2014.

NVDA can see all these trends, and they tried to respond. Firstly, with volumes clearly declining, and likely with a glut of second-hand GPUs that can make their way to gamers over time from the crypto space, NVDA decided to pursue a price over volume strategy. They released their most expensive set of GPUs by far in the latest Turing series. They added a new feature, Ray Tracing, by leveraging the Tensor Cores they had created for Professional uses, hoping to use that as justification for higher prices (more on this in the section on Professional GPUs). Unfortunately for NVDA, gamers have responded quite poorly to Ray Tracing – it caused performance issues, had poor support, poor adoption, and the visual improvements in most cases are not particularly noticeable or relevant.

The last recession led to gaming revenues falling 30%, despite NVDA being in a very strong position at the time vis-à-vis AMD – this time around their position is quickly slipping and it appears that the recession is going to be bigger. Additionally, the shift away from discrete GPUs in gaming continues.

To make matters worse for NVDA, AMD won the slots in both the New Xbox and the New PlayStation, coming out later this year. The performance of just the AMD GPU in those consoles looks to be competitive with NVidia products that currently retail for more than the entire console is likely to cost. Consider that usually you have to pair that NVidia GPU with a bunch of other expensive hardware. The pricing and margin impact of this console cycle on NVDA is likely to be very substantially negative.

It would be prudent to assume a greater than 30% fall in gaming revenues from the very elevated 2019 levels, with likely secular decline to follow.

**The Professional Market:**

A Bit of Ancient History (again, skip if impatient)

As it turns out, graphical accelerators were first used in the Professional market, long before they were employed for Gaming purposes. The big leader in the space was a company called Silicon Graphics, who sold workstations with custom silicon optimised for graphical processing. Their sales were only $25Mn in 1985, but by 1997 they were doing 3.6Bn in revenue – truly exponential growth. Unfortunately for them, from that point on, discrete GPUs took over, and their highly engineered, customised workstations looked exorbitantly expensive in comparison. Sales sank to 500mn by 2006 and, with no profits in sight, they ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2009. Competition is harsh in the semiconductor industry.

Initially, the Professional market centred on visualisation and design, but it has changed over time. There were a lot of players and lot of nuance, but I am going to focus on more recent times, as they are more relevant to NVidia.

**Some More Modern History**

NVDA’s Professional business started after its gaming business, but we don’t have revenue disclosures that show exactly when it became relevant. This is what we do have – going back to 2005:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr\_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI)

In the beginning, Professional revenues were focused on the 3D visualisation end of the spectrum, with initial sales going into workstations that were edging out the customised builds made by Silicon Graphics. Fairly quickly, however, GPUs added more and more functionality and started to turn into general parallel data processors rather than being solely optimised towards graphical processing.

As this change took place, people in scientific computing noticed, and started using GPUs to accelerate scientific workloads that involve very parallel computation, such as matrix manipulation. This started at the workstation level, but by 2007 NVDA decided to make a new line-up of Tesla series cards specifically suited to scientific computing. The professional segment now have several points of focus:

1. GPUs used in workstations for things such as CAD graphical processing (Quadro Line)
2. GPUs used in workstations for computational workloads such as running engineering simulations (Quadro Line)
3. GPUs used in workstations for machine learning applications (Quadro line.. but can use gaming cards as well for this)
4. GPUs used by enterprise customers for high performance computing (such as modelling oil wells) (Tesla Line)
5. GPUs used by enterprise customers for machine learning projects (Tesla Line)
6. GPUs used by hyperscalers (mostly for machine learning projects) (Tesla Line)

In more recent times, given the expansion of the Tesla line, NVDA has broken up reporting into Professional Visualisation (Quadro Line) and Datacenter (Tesla Line). Here are the revenue splits since that reporting started:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394798232158208/tumblr\_3AdufrCWUFwLgyQw2](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394798232158208/tumblr_3AdufrCWUFwLgyQw2)

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394810632601600/tumblr\_2jmajktuc0T78Juw7](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394810632601600/tumblr_2jmajktuc0T78Juw7)

It is worth stopping here and thinking about the huge increase in sales delivered by the Tesla line. The reason for this huge boom is the sudden increase in interest in numerical techniques for machine learning. Let’s go on a brief detour here to understand what machine learning is, because a lot of people want to hype it but not many want to tell you what it actually is. I have the misfortune of being very familiar with the industry, which prevented me from buying into the hype. Oops – sometimes it really sucks being educated.

**What is Machine Learning?**

At a very high level, machine learning is all about trying to get some sort of insight out of data. Most of the core techniques used in machine learning were developed a long time ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. The most common machine learning technique, which most people have heard of and may be vaguely familiar with, is called regression analysis. Regression analysis involves fitting a line through a bunch of datapoints. The most common type of regression analysis is called “Ordinary Least Squares” OLS regression, and that type of regression has a “closed form” solution, which means that there is a very simple calculation you can do to fit an OLS regression line to data.

As it happens, fitting a line through points is not only easy to do, it also tends to be the main machine learning technique that people want to use, because it is very intuitive. You can make good sense of what the data is telling you and can understand the machine learning model you are using. Obviously, regression analysis doesn’t require a GPU!

However, there is another consideration in machine learning: if you want to use a regression model, you still need a human to select the data that you want to fit the line through. Also, sometimes the relationship doesn’t look like a line, but rather it might look like a curve. In this case, you need a human to “transform” the data before you fit a line through it in order to make the relationship linear.

So people had another idea here: what if instead of getting a person to select the right data to analyse, and the right model to apply, you could just get a computer to do that? Of course the problem with that is that computers are really stupid. They have no preconceived notion of what data to use or what relationship would make sense, so what they do is TRY EVERYTHING! And everything involves trying a hell of a lot of stuff. And trying a hell of a lot of stuff, most of which is useless garbage, involves a huge amount of computation. People tried this for a while through to the 1980s, decided it was useless, and dropped it… until recently.

What changed? Well we have more data now, and we have a lot more computing power, so we figured lets have another go at it. As it happens, the premier technique for trying a hell of a lot of stuff (99.999% of which is garbage you throw away) is called “Deep Learning”. Deep learning is SUPER computationally intensive, and that computation happens to involve a lot of matrix multiplication. And guess what just happens to have been doing a lot of matrix multiplication? GPUs!

Here is a chart that, for obvious reasons, lines up extremely well with the boom in Tesla GPU sales:

Now we need to realise a few things here. Deep Learning is not some magic silver bullet. There are specific applications where it has proven very useful – primarily areas that have a very large number of very weak relationships between bits of data that sum up into strong relationships. An example of ones of those is Google Translate. On the other hand, in most analytical tasks, it is most useful to have an intuitive understanding of the data and to fit a simple and sensible model to it that is explainable. Deep learning models are not explainable in an intuitive manner. This is not only because they are complicated, but also because their scattershot technique of trying everything leaves a huge amount of garbage inside the model that cancels itself out when calculating the answer, but it is hard to see how it cancels itself out when stepping through it.

Given the quantum of hype on Deep learning and the space in general, many companies are using “Deep Learning”, “Machine Learning” and “AI” as marketing. Not many companies are actually generating significant amounts of tangible value from Deep Learning.

**Back to the Competitive Picture**

**For the Tesla Segment**

So NVDA happened to be in the right place at the right time to benefit from the Deep Learning hype. They happened to have a product ready to go and were able to charge a pretty penny for their product. But what happens as we proceed from here?

Firstly, it looks like the hype from Deep Learning has crested, which is not great from a future demand perspective. Not only that, but we really went from people having no GPUs, to people having GPUs. The next phase is people upgrading their old GPUs. It is much harder to sell an upgrade than to make the first sale.

Not only that, but GPUs are not the ideal manifestation of silicon for Deep Learning. NVDA themselves effectively admitted that with their latest iteration in the Datacentre, called Ampere. High Performance Computing, which was the initial use case for Tesla GPUs, was historically all about double precision floating point calculations (FP64). High precision calculations are required for simulations in aerospace/oil & gas/automotive.

NVDA basically sacrificed HPC and shifted further towards Deep Learning with Ampere, announced last Thursday. The FP64 performance of the A100 (the latest Ampere chip) increased a fairly pedestrian 24% from the V100, increasing from 7.8 to 9.7 TF. Not a surprise that NVDA lost El Capitan to AMD, given this shift away from a focus on HPC. Instead, NVDA jacked up their Tensor Cores (i.e. not the GPU cores) and focused very heavily on FP16 computation (a lot less precise than FP64). As it turns out, FP16 is precise enough for Deep Learning, and NVDA recognises that. The future industry standard is likely to be BFloat 16 – the format pioneered by Google, who lead in Deep Learning. Ampere now does 312 TF of BF16, which compares to the 420 TF of Google’s TPU V3 – Google’s Machine Learning specific processor. Not quite up to the 2018 board from Google, but getting better – if they cut out all of the Cuda cores and GPU functionality maybe they could get up to Google’s spec.

And indeed this is the problem for NVDA: when you make a GPU it has a large number of different use cases, and you provide a single product that meets all of these different use cases. That is a very hard thing to do, and explains why it has been difficult for competitors to muscle into the GPU space. On the other hand, when you are making a device that does one thing, such as deep learning, it is a much simpler thing to do. Google managed to do it with no GPU experience and is still ahead of NVDA. It is likely that Intel will be able to enter this space successfully, as they have widely signalled with the Xe.

There is of course the other large negative driver for Deep Learning, and that is the recession we are now in. Demand for GPU instances on Amazon has collapsed across the board, as evidenced by the fall in pricing. The below graph shows one example: this data is for renting out a single Tesla V100 GPU on AWS, which isthe typical thing to do in an early exploratory phase for a Deep Learning model:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr\_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh)

With Deep Learning not delivering near-term tangible results, it is the first thing being cut. On their most recent conference call, IBM noted weakness in their cognitive division (AI), and noted weaker sales of their power servers, which is the line that houses Enterprise GPU servers at IBM. Facebook cancelled their AI residencies for this year, and Google pushed theirs out. Even if NVDA can put in a good quarter due to their new product rollout  (Ampere), the future is rapidly becoming a very stormy place.

**For the Quadro segment**

The Quadro segment has been a cash cow for a long time, generating dependable sales and solid margins. AMD just decided to rock the boat a bit. Sensing NVDA’s focus on Deep Learning, AMD seems to be focusing on HPC – the Radeon VII announced recently with a price point of $1899 takes aim at NVDAs most expensive Quadro, the GV100, priced at $8999. It does 6.5 TFLOPS of FP64 Double precision, whereas the GV100 does 7.4 – talk about shaking up a quiet segment.

**Pulling things together**

Let’s go back to what NVidia fundamentally does – paying their engineers to design chips, getting TSMC to print those chips, and getting board partners in Taiwan to turn them into the final product.

We have seen how a confluence of several pieces of extremely good fortune lined up to increase NVidia’s sales and profits tremendously: first on the Gaming side, weak competition from AMD until 2014, coupled with a great product in form of Pascal in 2016, followed by a huge crypto driven boom in 2017 and 2018, and on the Professional side, a sudden and unexpected increase in interest in Deep Learning driving Tesla demand from 2017-2019 sky high.

It is worth noting what these transient factors have done to margins. When unexpected good things happen to a chip company, sales go up a lot, but there are no costs associated with those sales. Strong demand means that you can sell each chip for a higher price, but no additional design work is required, and you still pay the printer, TSMC, the same amount of money. Consequently NVDA’s margins have gone up substantially: well above their 11.9% long term average to hit a peak of 33.2%, and more recently 26.5%:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr\_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP)

The question is, what would be a sensible margin going forward? Obviously 33% operating margin would attract a wall of competition and get competed away, which is why they can only be temporary. However, NVidia has shifted to having a greater proportion of its sales coming from non-OEM, and has a greater proportion of its sales coming from Professional rather than gaming. As such, maybe one can be generous and say NVDA can earn an 18% average operating margin over the next cycle. We can sense check these margins, using Intel. Intel has a long term average EBIT margin of about 25%. Intel happens to actually print the chips as well, so they collect a bigger fraction of the final product that they sell. NVDA, since it only does the design aspect, can’t earn a higher EBIT margin than Intel on average over the long term.

Tesla sales have likely gone too far and will moderate from here – perhaps down to a still more than respectable $2bn per year. Gaming resumes the long-term slide in discrete GPUs, which will likely be replaced by integrated GPUs to a greater and greater extent over time. But let’s be generous and say it maintains $3.5 Bn Per year for the add in board, and let’s assume we keep getting $750mn odd of Nintendo Switch revenues(despite that product being past peak of cycle, with Nintendo themselves forecasting a sales decline). Let’s assume AMD struggles to make progress in Quadro, despite undercutting NVDA on price by 75%, with continued revenues at $1200. Add on the other 1.2Bn of Automotive, OEM and IP (I am not even counting the fact that car sales have collapsed and Automotive is likely to be down big), and we would end up with revenues of $8.65 Bn, at an average operating margin of 20% through the cycle that would have $1.75Bn of operating earnings power, and if I say that the recent Mellanox acquisition manages to earn enough to pay for all the interest on NVDAs debt, and I assume a tax rate of 15% we would have around $1.5Bn in Net income.

This company currently has a market capitalisation of $209 Bn. It blows my mind that it trades on 139x what I consider to be fairly generous earnings – earnings that NVidia never even got close to seeing before the confluence of good luck hit them. But what really stuns me is the fact that investors are actually willing to extrapolate this chain of unlikely and positive events into the future.

Shockingly, Intel has a market cap of 245Bn, only 40Bn more than NVDA, but Intel’s sales and profits are 7x higher. And while Intel is facing competition from AMD, it is much more likely to hold onto those sales and profits than NVDA is. These are absolutely stunning valuation disparities.

If I didn’t see NVDA’s price, and I started from first principles and tried to calculate a prudent price for the company I would have estimated a$1.5Bn normalised profit, maybe on a 20x multiple giving them the benefit of the doubt despite heading into a huge recession, and considering the fact that there is not much debt and the company is very well run. That would give you a market cap of $30Bn, and a share price of $49. And it is currently $339. Wow. Obviously I’m short here!"
Anyone else think the dip on semiconductors will be a once in a decade opportunity to build wealth?,"Two major catalysts playing out for semis right now:

* Fed raising rates.
* Russia sanctions and possible invasion [cutting off key semiconductor materials](https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-tells-chip-industry-brace-russian-supply-disruptions-2022-02-11/).

In the next few months, these will play out and really pummel the semi stocks. But the good news is these are temporary events. After 1-2 years, we'll find a way around Russian chokehold on these key materials, and inflation will probably be slowed. While that's happening, covid is still subsiding and innovation continue it's relentless march of driving productivity forward.

To be clear, **I'm not saying to buy the dip right now.** But I'm tempted to start a ""eat ramen"", ""get a third job"", ""cancel Netflix"" regime for myself to start preparing as much as possible to start buying mid or later this year.

These semi stocks are becoming the new FANGS, and this upcoming dip this year might be the best chance to buy them before they rocket into FANG status.

OK here's the cons in my theory:

* China could still be a ticking time bomb. Most experts say their lockdown strategy is not viable for Omicron. Could be their supply chain is a lot more broken than we realize. Plus that real estate problem is still ongoing and their president is kinda insane.

* The Fed could freak out and raise rates too quickly, putting us into a recession.

* Some industry reports say oversupply of semiconductors could happen as early as 2023.

"Apple stock closes at an all-time-high, added $1 trillion to its market cap in 2023","Apple (AAPL) achieved a new record high yesterday, closing at $197.96, up 1.67% for the day.   
  
The company consistently outperforms its peers and is one of only five US companies valued at over $1 trillion. Notably, on December 6, 2023, Apple surpassed a $3 trillion total market valuation.   
  
Throughout 2023, Apple increased its market cap by $1 trillion, reaching a total valuation of $4 trillion expected in 2024 if the pace continues.

Made no money because I listened to my dad,"This is my dad: [https://imgur.com/a/YsNBJRM](https://imgur.com/a/YsNBJRM)

I began investing in 2017. I wanted to buy Apple and Microsoft, but he told me they were too high, and I should wait for a crash. And he wouldn't shut up about the coming crash. I guess I internalized what he was saying and ended up focusing on ""cheap"" stocks and ""value investing.""

7 years later, my portfolio is -5%.

I didn't have enough money to buy the dip in 2020 because all of my money was tied up in stuff like $WBA, $SPG, and $SJM. Lol.

Only these past two years, I started to shift strategies and buy good businesses with actual prospects. That's why I'm down only -5% rather than -35%.

I'm just ranting. I can't believe I wasted so much time researching ""undervalued"" companies and couldn't even beat cash interest. I'm only 29 at least, so hopefully I can still grow my portfolio. But I missed out on some of the best years of the S&P...

Oh yeah, I'm holding some NVDA and yesterday my dad was screaming at me to sell, and how it's too high, and ""it can't go up forever."" I was really annoyed, so I created the image above and sent it to him.

Oh, he also lost hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past 30 years. I grew up watching my parents fight over money all the time. Don't know why I ever listened to him.

I did make plenty of my own mistakes, of course. And it's ultimately my fault for following his advice. I think I've learned a lot so I don't feel as much of a need to rely on other people anymore. I guess I'm just really annoyed that he's still saying the same thing as he did back then.

OK, thanks for listening to my venting. "
How is DoorDash a 62 billion company?,"I am interested in hearing a bull case for doordash. I've seen many youtube videos, reddit posts, articles on why this stock is overvalued at 18 price to sales ratio which implies at least 20-25% sales growth (sales growth 6-9x) for the next 10 years based on my model. Even Uber, which I consider to be massively overvalued, (because of its unprofitable low margin,no moat, slowing growth business) is trading only 17 billion marketcap more for postmates, uber eats and most dominant ride haling service.(63 vs 80 bil)

With earnings miss, i would thought that this stock would go down, but doordash ended the day up 3.5% while airbnb is barely up on better earnings. Even Disney stock, which crushed earnings, is only up 1%, and trades at a more reasonable valuation. In my opinion, you cant miss earnings, and expect to go up, yet DoorDash did and the guidance wasnt that great either.

So why did doordash go up today on earnings? I didn't see any reddit post on doordash earnings, in fact I rarely hear anyone talk about this stock which is surprising considering its a 62 billion growth company. ( i hear more people discuss corsair which is a 2 billion company) Yet, despite the earnings miss, analysts kept upgrading the price targets for this stock today yet they never explain why they upgraded doordash.

I would like to hear your thoughts on why this stock is worth the price, I always like to hear bull cases, on companies I find overvalued (i enjoy reading opinions on crowdstrike, nvidia, moderna so even thought I find those stocks are overvalued I understand the market valuation is so high on those companies.) Alot of stocks that I believe to have positive sentiment isn't really moving higher, like sofi, disney, shift, alibaba, amazon while stocks that I see have more negative sentiment on youtube/reddit like doordash, carvana, zoom are performing relatively better? (Even Nikola is still worth 4-5 billion somehow)

In short, I am interested in hearing a bull case for doordash and why doordash went up on earnings while most stocks went down on earnings (like sofi, ttcf, which is consider to be reasonable valuation but fell 15%)"

Nvidia hits $1 trillion market cap,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/30/nvidia-on-track-to-hit-1-trillion-market-cap-when-market-opens.html

Nvidia briefly hit a $1 trillion market cap at the open Tuesday, joining a small club of mostly technology companies. Nvidia’s shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker’s stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia’s gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.

Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It’s been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week’s trading.

Nvidia’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called “discrete” or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs. The company hasn’t shared, comparatively, in the wave of investor interest."
I'm happy to admit that I'm a total idiot,"I'm not trying to pass as a genius or savvy investor at all but most of my positions have been up. I started investing in mid June 2016 and there was a time I dipped into 3x leveraged ETFs like JNUG hoping to make quick bucks. I failed and lost a bit of money (about $3000). Back then I read charts like crazy, trying to predict the trend, looking to the Fed minutes, etc. Guess what? One day I was sure that my positions would go up and when the Fed released their statement, it went down.

I was sick of it. In the very beginning, I invested in AMD, NVIDIA, APPLE, and TWITTER. During all that time I toiled over fundamentals, charts, etc, those stocks steadily climbed. I realized had I not trying to get rich quick, I would be in far better position with those simple blue chip stocks. 

So I changed the way I invest.

I stopped paying too much attention to the news. I stopped reading annual reports, I don't care what the fundamentals are, I wouldn't give a damn if the apocalypse hit tomorrow. Candlesticks, earning, financial statements are all meaningless.

I buy and DCA (Dollar cost average) everything. Every paycheck I set aside a certain amount and put into stocks and ETF

This is my current portfolio

AMD, NVDA, APPL, MSFT, VOO, VTI, SPY, SCHG, VGT, XLK, FINX, QQQ, QTEC, FTEC, ESPO, SMH, MGK.

If you think ""ha, this idiot actually bought SPY and VOO, they are the same shit""

Yes, that's why I admitted I'm an idiot. Perhaps a lucky idiot. The only stock that I lost money is SQ. I bought it at all time high in 2018 and the stock went nearly sideway in 2019 so I sold it at a loss of $200 and invested that money into something else. All of my positions have been going up.

Sometimes I tried to dabble into options trading after seeing mad gains from wallstreetbet. 

The main problem: again, I'm an idiot. A happy idiot in fact. No matter how much I read/watch YT videos, I don't understand theta, delta, exercise, short leg, long leg, time value, intrinsic value, strike price. Ok, I do understand the definitions but I don't know how they can connect to each other to make me money. 

So I dropped option trading completely, not even attempt to do anything about it

My portfolio hit all time low on March 20 at -17.33%, today it hit all time high at 18%. It climbed about 40% for the past 3 months

All due to DCA. I steadily put money into stock every 2 weeks. I don't care if the market hit all time high or all time low, I buy. When RH crashed and everyone freaked out, it didn't affect me one bit. 

When I read the story about that guy who took his life over 700k loss, I realize it could be me had I not learn anything from the early $3000 loss. I don't do well with stress. I want to go home after work at night, check my stocks for 5 minutes, eat something, fap, and go to bed. I don't ever want to stress out every minutes of my life over things I can't control: the market.

I don't try to give anyone advice because I'm still a learner. All I ever do is to expand my portfolio and put some more money every paycheck.

But before you buy any book or subscribe to any stock-picking or teaching service, do you realize that stocks picked by a monkey can beat the market?

I wouldn't waste money in any of that. Every penny I'm not putting into stock is a penny I lose from profit.

"Nvidia earnings fall short, Q3 forecast misses by $1 billion","Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA?p=NVDA&.tsrc=fin-srch)) [announced its fiscal Q2 earnings](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2023) after the bell on Wednesday, missing on earnings per share and falling short on Q3 forecasts amid a slowdown in PC and gaming sales following the explosive growth the sectors saw in 2020 and 2021. Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what analysts were expecting.

* **Revenue:** $6.7 billion versus $6.7 billion expected
* **Adj. EPS:** $0.51 versus $0.53 expected
* **Data Center:** $3.8 billion versus $3.8 billion expected
* **Gaming:** $2.0 billion versus $2.0 billion expected

Net income for the company fell 72% year-over-year to $656 million. Shares of Nvidia were down more than 2% following the announcement.

Nvidia also announced Q3 revenue projections that fell short of expectations, saying it will bring in $5.9 billion in the quarter. Wall Street was looking for $6.9 billion.

""We are navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment and we will get through this,” Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.

Nvidia released its preliminary earnings on Aug. 8, warnings investors that the company was going to miss on its own expectations for the quarter as gaming sales continued to plummet.

According to the company's numbers, gaming segment revenue dropped an eye-watering 33% year-over-year and 44% quarter-over-quarter. Fellow gaming companies including Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch)), Sony ([SONY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SONY?p=SONY&.tsrc=fin-srch)), Nintendo ([NTDOY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NTDOY?p=NTDOY&.tsrc=fin-srch)), and others have also reported a drop in game hardware spending."
Nvidia briefly passes $3 trillion market cap on back of AI boom ,"Nvidia surpassed $3 trillion in market cap during intraday trading on Wednesday as investors continue to clamor for the company making most of the chips powering the AI boom.

Nvidia shares were up more than 4% to $1,219 at one point during intraday trading on Wednesday.

Nvidia’s milestone is the latest stunning mark in a run where the stock price has gone parabolic as investors bet on artificial intelligence. Shares are up over 3,224% over the last five years. It will split its stock 10-1 later this month.

Apple was the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion market cap in January 2022. Microsoft hit $3 trillion in market value in January 2024.

In May, Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings that suggested demand for the company’s pricey and powerful AI chips, often called GPUs, showed no sign of slowing down. Nvidia reported overall sales of $26 billion, more than triple what the company reported a year ago. Nvidia also beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings and said it would report revenue of about $28 billion in the current quarter.

Nvidia shares have surged in recent years, powered by the tech industry’s need for its chips, which are used to develop and deploy big artificial intelligence models like the one at the heart of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Companies such as Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are buying billions of dollars of Nvidia’s graphics processing units.

NVDA: another painful lesson in selling,"I've said numerous times in this sub that my most painful mistake over my investing career by far has been selling prematurely. But I'm human, and I still occasionally make the same stupid mistake.

I bought NVDA a year ago at around $234. I watched in horror as it dropped to a low of almost $110, but I patiently held on. Then it started to rebound nicely late last year but I started getting concerned, hearing lots of people talk about the supply glut in chips and valuation concerns and blah, blah, blah. So I decided to cut my losses around $160. And here we are, back right to my purchase price.

Yet another painful reminder that for long term investors, the only reason to sell (unless you really need the capital) is if the thesis for making the investment in the first place no longer applies. Don't sell because of macro concerns, hypothetical risks, or because of valuation."

* The losses cumulatively add up to roughly $540B in lost market cap, placing Nvidia firmly behind Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) in the race for the most valuable company on the planet. The Jensen Huang-led Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company earlier this month.
* Year-to-date, Nvidia shares are up 145%, buoyed by a surge in data center revenue amid heavy spending on artificial intelligence.
* Separately on Monday, Taiwan news outlet UDN reported that the GB200 GPU is in short supply."
Nvidia announces Blackwell AI chips that will launch later this year,"Nvidia on Monday announced a new generation of artificial intelligence chips and software for running AI models. The announcement, made during Nvidia’s developer’s conference in San Jose, comes as the chipmaker seeks to solidify its position as the go-to supplier for AI companies.

Nvidia’s share price is up five-fold and total sales have more than tripled since OpenAI’s ChatGPT kicked off the AI boom in late 2022. Nvidia’s high-end server GPUs are essential for training and deploying large AI models. Companies like Microsoft and Meta have spent billions of dollars buying the chips.

The new generation of AI graphics processors is named Blackwell. The first Blackwell chip is called the GB200 and will ship later this year. Nvidia is enticing its customers with more powerful chips to spur new orders. Companies and software makers, for example, are still scrambling to get their hands on the current generation of H100s and similar chips.

“Hopper is fantastic, but we need bigger GPUs,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Monday at the company’s developer conference in San Jose, California. “Let me introduce you to a very big GPU.”

The company also introduced revenue-generating software called NIM that will make it easier to deploy AI, giving customers another reason to stick with Nvidia chips over a rising field of competitors.

Nvidia executives say that the company is becoming less of a mercenary chip provider and more of a platform provider, like Microsoft or Apple, on which other companies can build software.

“The sellable commercial product was the GPU and the software was all to help people use the GPU in different ways,” said Nvidia enterprise VP Manuvir Das in an interview. “Of course, we still do that. But what’s really changed is, we really have a commercial software business now.”

Das said Nvidia’s new software will make it easier to run programs on any of Nvidia’s GPUs, even older ones that might be better suited for deploying but not building AI.

“If you’re a developer, you’ve got an interesting model you want people to adopt, if you put it in a NIM, we’ll make sure that it’s runnable on all our GPUs, so you reach a lot of people,” Das said.

Every two years Nvidia updates its GPU architecture, unlocking a big jump in performance. Many of the AI models released over the past year were trained on the company’s Hopper architecture — used by chips such as the H100 — which was announced in 2022.

Nvidia says Blackwell-based processors, like the GB200, offer a huge performance upgrade for AI companies, with 20 petaflops in AI performance versus 4 petaflops for the H100. The additional processing power will enable AI companies to train bigger and more intricate models, Nvidia said.

The chip includes what Nvidia calls a “transformer engine specifically built to run transformers-based AI, one of the core technologies underpinning ChatGPT.

The Blackwell GPU is large and combines two separately manufactured dies into one chip manufactured by TSMC. It will also be available as an entire server called the GB200 NVLink 2, combining 72 Blackwell GPUs and other Nvidia parts designed to train AI models.

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle will sell access to the GB200 through cloud services. The GB200 pairs two B200 Blackwell GPUs with one Arm-based Grace CPU. Nvidia said Amazon Web Services would build a server cluster with 20,000 GB200 chips.

Nvidia said that the system can deploy a 27-trillion-parameter model. That’s much larger than even the biggest models, such as GPT-4, which reportedly has 1.7 trillion parameters. Many artificial intelligence researchers believe bigger models with more parameters and data could unlock new capabilities.

Nvidia didn’t provide a cost for the new GB200 or the systems it’s used in. Nvidia’s Hopper-based H100 costs between $25,000 and $40,000 per chip, with whole systems that cost as much as $200,000, according to analyst estimates.

Nvidia also announced it’s adding a new product named NIM to its Nvidia enterprise software subscription.

NIM makes it easier to use older Nvidia GPUs for inference, or the process of running AI software, and will allow companies to continue to use the hundreds of millions of Nvidia GPUs they already own. Inference requires less computational power than the initial training of a new AI model. NIM enables companies that want to run their own AI models, instead of buying access to AI results as a service from companies like OpenAI.

The strategy is to get customers who buy Nvidia-based servers to sign up for Nvidia enterprise, which costs $4,500 per GPU per year for a license.

Nvidia will work with AI companies like Microsoft or Hugging Face to ensure their AI models are tuned to run on all compatible Nvidia chips. Then, using a NIM, developers can efficiently run the model on their own servers or cloud-based Nvidia servers without a lengthy configuration process.

“In my code, where I was calling into OpenAI, I will replace one line of code to point it to this NIM that I got from Nvidia instead,” Das said.

Nvidia says the software will also help AI run on GPU-equipped laptops, instead of on servers in the cloud.

Nvidia Quietly Prepares to Abandon $40 Billion Arm Bid - Bloomberg,"Nvidia Corp. is quietly preparing to abandon its purchase of Arm Ltd. from SoftBank Group Corp. after making little to no progress in winning approval for the $40 billion chip deal, according to people familiar with the matter.

Nvidia has told partners that it doesn’t expect the transaction to close, according to one person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. SoftBank, meanwhile, is stepping up preparations for an Arm initial public offering as an alternative to the Nvidia takeover, another person said.

Nvidia pays $5.5 million for allegedly hiding how many gaming GPUs were sold to crypto miners,"Link to article from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/6/23059930/nvidia-sec-charges-fine-settlement-gaming-gpu-crypto-mining)

""Nvidia will pay $5.5 million to settle charges that it unlawfully obscured how many of its graphics cards were sold to cryptocurrency miners. The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to “gaming,” hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isn’t admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.

The charges stem from Nvidia’s fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line specifically for mining, attempting to prevent shortages for gamers. But employees apparently acknowledged that many gaming GPUs were still going to miners. “The company’s sales personnel, in particular in China, reported what they believed to be significant increases in demand for Gaming GPUs as a result of crypto mining,” the order says.

Given the boom-and-bust nature of cryptocurrency, this meant Nvidia’s sales numbers didn’t necessarily indicate reliable future growth, making investing in it riskier. “NVIDIA’s analysts and investors were interested in understanding the extent to which the company’s Gaming revenue was impacted by crypto mining and routinely asked senior management about the extent to which increases in gaming revenue during this time frame were driven by crypto mining,” the SEC alleges.

Despite this, Nvidia didn’t mention mining-related sales as a factor in its gaming division’s success. Meanwhile, it mentioned crypto as an important factor in other markets, which suggested to the SEC that it was being deliberately deceptive. And investors’ anxieties turned out to be well-founded. A crypto crash in late 2018 (along with a weakening Chinese market) led it to slash its quarterly earnings projections by $500 million and spurred a shareholder lawsuit.

“NVIDIA’s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market,” says SEC Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit head Kristina Littman. “All issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.”"""
"NVIDIA beat earnings, top expectations.","Nvidia reported its fiscal first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom line on the strength of its data center business. The company also said it expects Q2 revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $7.2 billion.

Nvidia is at the center of the AI explosion thanks to its high-powered graphics cards and server products, and its stock price is soaring. Over the last year, shares of Nvidia have jumped 77%, while rival AMD has jumped 12%. Intel shares are down 30% in the same timeframe.

Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what was expecting, as compiled by Bloomberg.

Revenue: $7.2 billion versus $6.5 billion expected

Adj. EPS: $1.09 versus $0.92 expected

Gaming: $2.2 billion versus $1.9 billion expected

Data center: $4.2 billion versus $3.9 billion expected

Shares of Nvidia were up more than 13% following the announcement.

“The computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions — accelerated computing and generative AI,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement."

"$BB King – The Blacker the Berry, the Sweeter the Juice","**BB King baby**

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

**2.4.2021 Prelude**:

If you are new to this DD, just continue on through below. If you have been keeping in touch, I mentioned this stock back in the $6 area and we managed to hit $28+ in such a short period of time. Lots and lots of firepower. To be frank, and many who have messaged me know, I started scaling out past 15 and closed out last Monday in the $20 area. Why? Because I wanted the stock to cool off and to let the market determine who really wanted to invest and own the stock, and who wanted it for the trade cause BRRRRR BB GO UP. Well, I’m back in, and here are my updates and reasons why. In addition, BB is decoupling from the GME trade, and should see much more lift comparatively.

**Intro**

Man Blackberry, who the hell thought I’d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you’re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.

It is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing.

**Let’s begin**:

BB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. 
BB stock price, 9.84 as of Close on 1-18-2021. Only 9 days since I first posted. This is just the beginning.
BB stock price, 12 as of Close on 2-3-2021. Hit a high of 28.77 the week prior…this moved so fast.

**Technical 2.4.2021**

On the 4hr, volume is really cooling down lately and it seems to me that sellers are REALLY drying up. People that didn’t even want to part with their BB shares capitulated. Now we likely wash out yesterday’s nice move upwards before continuing to the upside. MACD cross/flip, Moving Averages basing, just looks overall quite nice.


**Recent Earnings**

Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast | % Surprise
---|---|----|----|----
Nov 2020	| 12/17/2020	| 0	| -0.04	| 100
Aug 2020	| 09/24/2020	| 0.1	| -0.02	| 600
May 2020	| 06/24/2020	| 0	| -0.04	| 100
Feb 2020	| 03/31/2020	| 0.06	|0.01	|500

Surprises along the board.

Revenues Q3, $224 MM.

Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM. This will be beaten immensely.

Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. 

Mkt cap, $4 B. 

Total company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.


**NEWS EVENTS**

FB settlement

BB won a suit against Zuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and whatnot. This settlement has now occurred. Check Bloomberg for the deets

Someone I know and trust let me know that there are rumors that the settlement is worth $2B and a 2 year partnership. This is not fact, just rumor, but if it is true that is MASSIVE.

BlackBerry IVY – Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform

The big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”

What does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers)

**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**

BlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:

* Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences
* Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models
* Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge & reducing raw data transmission
* Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access
* Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community
Videos on their YT

Want a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info?  [Read this](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws) and watch their conferences that they have done or are coming up.

The IVY deal has so much commercial promise. Manufacturers are going to buy IVY because of the data gathering, but more importantly IVY is going to become the universal app store for automotive apps. The IVY platform will be universal across manufacturers and models so a developer can build an app that will work on any car that has IVY. BB will take an app store like commission on revenue. Billions.

After cars, IVY and QNX will move to the broader Internet of Things. Planes, trains, medical devices, EVERYTHING will be connected and needs to be secure. BB has competitive advantages over all the other players, especially Linux because it is not secure, while BB’s QNX has the highest achievable safety certs.

If the automotive biz wasn’t enough they have interesting offerings in corporate data security, anti-virus, and emergency notification systems. They are literally in some of the hottest spaces you could be right now, with no signs of cooling.
As of their conferences, IVY and QNX both seem to be opening up many many more avenues of revenue to tackle within the auto space. Per Steve Rai, what was typically 2-3 avenues of revenue is not 5-6, with IVY being a HUGE 7th.

**Partnerships with big companies**

Blackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and ServiceNow. BB’s Incident Management Response System AtHoc is integrating into the NOW platform. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY. I think this should pull above $10 MM per month, $120MM a year? Sounds enticing to me when we are at $~1B revenue with a 76% gross margin.

Sony announced a BlackBerry partnership, per CEO @JohnChen on Twitter: Thank you for your partnership @Sony. You are an icon and I look forward to experiencing your #ElectricVehicle embedded with @BlackBerry software. But first, where I can get a #Playstation5? #EV#PS5

BB & BAIDU announced their partnership too!

**Patents**

BB Selling Smartphone Patents to Huawei, more $$$$ coming in. Recent Sale news here: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/?cmpid=rss&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter

BB JUST won a suit against Facebook for one of the patents they hold: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/blackberry-and-facebook-are-in-process-of-global-settlement. This is minimum likely worth $500 MM+, but to my knowledge off of some juicy rumors, this is a $2B settlement with FB and a 2 year partnership. MASSIVE.

**Business Implications**

BB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?

Bubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn’t have competition? They cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock.

Here is the biggest catch: Right now the auto industry is actually selling less cars, and many of the EVs that BB is partnered with are really in the liftoff phase. When XPEV (my favorite EV and I am working on my print for them as we speak), NIO, BIDU, Hyundai, get their EV and Self Driving Cars off the ground and start growing their vehicle output, this number will grow and grow. BB is really at the brink of an explosive couple of years. You are entering at the ground floor.

**CONFERENCES**  

BB has just spoken at the following conferences:
Citi’s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

JP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

Needham’s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference with Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect.

Upcoming conference on Feb 22nd, 2 PM EST with **AMZN** and **BB**. Will update with a link when I get the chance

**Conclusion**:

This stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. ~~This trades at $6.70.~~ They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile apps, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren’t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. 

From here, 12.5 leads to 15, 28, and probably some wild momentum to 40-50. More shorts have entered, likely more institutions have entered long. It is an exciting time for Blackberry, let’s roll

Nvidia Seeing 'Massive Demand' For Graphics Cards Thanks To Gaming,"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/nvidia-stock-gets-price-target-hike-graphics-card-demand/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo

""Nvidia (is) benefiting from continued massive demand for graphics cards, according to our supply-chain measurements,"" Eric Ross, chief investment strategist for Cascend Securities, said in a note to clients. Current-quarter demand looks ""like a holiday quarter,"" he said.

""We're not a fan of the Arm acquisition because there are huge hurdles in approval,"" Ross said. ""There is a high likelihood this deal will die at the regulators (we're thinking China).""

The deal will require regulatory approval from the U.S., U.K., European Union and China.

Thanks for the awards."
NEW TRADERS: The internet is loaded with bad advice on buying individual stocks—your core portfolio should be built on old principles,"All I see in Reddit, Twitter, and social media is bad advice for the flood of new traders getting into the market right now. For every random post you see of someone claiming to have made a fortune on an individual stock, there are 40 people who tried and failed, and just didn’t post about it.

Most new traders see that the market is raging and think they can jump into investing and become rich in 3 months by just buying and selling off an initial $5k investment a few times. Here’s the reality: proper investing takes time (patience), discipline (holding), and work (research). For 90%+ of people, your best strategy is in ETFs.

For 100% of people, your best strategy is putting the core of your portfolio in ETFs. Your investments in individual stocks should ONLY be a supplement—ie buying high conviction, high upside plays that won’t damage your portfolio’s stability if you lose. The number of people out there who seem to think a portfolio with 50% PLTR is a legitimate investment strategy is extremely alarming, and they are going to end up losing a lot of money. Maybe not on that stock, but on one of them as they continue down that path.

If you want to invest, you should take the time to read John Bogle’s “little book of common sense investing” to understand why ETFs always beat 90%+ of investment strategies. Also everyone should read Benjamin Graham’s “Intelligent Investor”. If you don’t have time, why would you think you have time to invest?

The distilled version is that the market always broadly goes up in the long term, buying and holding a diversified s&p500 ETF with very low fees (like VOO) is the surest way to guarantee your fair share of returns. Almost everyone on this sub would have better returns over 30 years if they did nothing but that. But of course, that isn’t fun for people.

But know this—the market will come down from here. It is trading well above value. If your money is disproportionately in individual stocks, you have no guarantee of it coming back.

If you’re new to investing out at least 90% of your money in VOO and leave it alone. Forever. The rest you can take shots at individual stocks with. When you add money to your portfolio, add at least 50% to VOO and then with the left over you can buy individual stocks. Do this for AT LEAST a year, but 3 would be better.

If you’re experienced you don’t need me to tell you this but 60% of yours portfolio should still be in ETFs.

Good luck out there. I don’t know when it will come down, but it will.

EDIT: after some people calling me a “boomer” and questioning my selection, I’ll provide disclosures. It’s true that I do not own only ETFs. But I have been investing for a lot while. A bit over 60% of my portfolio is in ETFs or holding companies (BRKB)

Intel to invest $4.6 billion in new chip plant in Poland,"Intel plans to invest up to $4.6 billion in a new semiconductor assembly and test facility near Wrocław, Poland, as part of a multi-billion-dollar investment drive across Europe to build chip capacity, it said on Friday.

The U.S. chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany along with facilities in Ireland and France as it seeks to benefit from European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU looks to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.

The facility in Poland will employ 2,000 workers and create several thousand additional jobs during the construction phase and hiring by suppliers, the company said in a statement.

""Poland was just a little bit hungrier to win this site,"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a news conference.

Several countries have been vying to get Intel to invest in their regions and some, like Germany, who have secured a commitment from Intel, have been in talks on the amount of subsidies they can doll out.

Handelsblatt newspaper reported on Thursday that the German government and Intel were close to an agreement for 9.9 billion euros ($10.83 billion) in subsidies, up from a previously agreed 6.8 billion.

""We are not asking for handouts, we are asking for competitiveness,"" Gelsinger said in an interview.

""Labour costs have gone up substantially, material costs have gone up substantially, so all of a sudden, the cost gap was bigger than we had originally estimated.""

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will meet with Gelsinger on Monday, a government spokesperson said in Berlin.

Gelsinger declined to provide detail on the subsidy amount, but said he hopes to come to an agreement.

""The gaps are too big. If we close them, we shake hands, and we are going forward,"" Gelsinger said.

The level of any subsidy offered to Intel by Poland was not made public during Friday's announcement.

Design and planning for the facility will begin immediately, with construction to commence pending European Commission approval.

Mateusz Morawiecki, prime minister of Poland, called Intel's factory ""the largest greenfield investment in the history of Poland"".

The company, which has been in the country for 30 years and employs 4,000 workers, said it chose Poland because of its infrastructure, available talent and noted the site is close to its planned factory in Germany and its site in Ireland.

It expects the facility to come online by 2027.

Intel under Gelsinger has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chip making and better compete with rivals AMD, NVIDIA and Samsung.

Why would anybody buy anything before Jerome opens his mouth next Tuesday/Wednesday? You know it's going lower,"So, I'm watching prices for various stocks that I'm interested in drop pretty nicely today, but my trigger finger remains immobilized. Adobe, dropping as low as $305 (new 52 week low), Microsoft dropping back into the mid 240's, AMD dropping to the mid 70's. Nvidia under $130. Seems like lots of great opportunities. Why not buy these puppies right now?

I just can't. You know damn well that Jerome Powell is going to say something next Tuesday or Wednesday that's going to spook the markets again. Sure, the markets will likely overreact to the downside, and then recover a bit about a week later, but won't ADBE, MSFT, NVDA, AMD, etc, etc, all be EVEN LOWER after Jerome spooks everybody next week?

Why are people buying right now? Contrarian thinking?"
"Meta Platforms drops out of top 10 companies by value, with new 4% dip","Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:FB) worst month ever continues: The stock tacked on another 4.1% loss Thursday, another $24 billion in market capitalization out the window as the stock dropped out of the top 10 most valuable companies.

At a value of $565 billion, Facebook fell to the No. 11 spot, a ways behind Tencent Holdings at No. 10. During the fall, Meta has stumbled past companies including Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, Nvidia, and Taiwan Semiconductor.

When it was Facebook, Meta had been among the top five or six most valuable companies in the world for the past few years.

Meta's now near a two-year low, at its lowest point since May 2020.

Thursday's move accelerated a staggering loss of value that amounts to a 46% decline from an all-time high of $382.96 on Sept. 7. The amount of market value it's lost is bigger than nearly every company in the S&P 500.

Earlier Thursday, MoffettNathanson mounted something of a defense of the stock, suggesting that the company's story is more complicated than it appears and the stock is trading at a discount."
"Berlin, Intel strike deal on $33 billion chip plant after months of subsidy talks","BERLIN/STOCKHOLM, June 19 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O) will invest more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in Germany as part of its expansion push in Europe, the U.S. company said on Monday, a project key to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ambitions to create a global chip hub.  
  
The deal, which involves two leading-edge semiconductor facilities, involves 10 billion euros in German subsidies, a person familiar with the matter said.  
  
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said he was grateful to the German government and the local state of Saxony-Anhalt, where the company plans to built one plant, for ""fulfilling the vision of a vibrant, sustainable, leading-edge semiconductor industry in Germany and the EU"".  
  
Under Gelsinger, Intel (INTC.O) has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chipmaking and better compete with rivals AMD (AMD.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Samsung (005930.KS).  
  
The deal in Germany would be Intel's third big investment in four days, following a $4.6 billion chip plant in Poland and a $25 billion factory in Israel.  
  
Both the United States and Europe are trying to lure big industrial players via a mix of state subsidies and favourable legislation, with Berlin concerned about losing appeal as a place to invest.  
  
The German government is investing billions of euros in subsidies to lure tech companies to Germany amidst growing alarm over supply chain fragility and dependence on South Korea and Taiwan for chips.  
  
Berlin is currently also talking with Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) and Sweden's electric vehicle battery maker Northvolt about setting up production in Germany, having already convinced Tesla (TSLA.O) to build its first European gigafactory there.  
  
Frankfurt-listed Intel shares were 0.3% lower at 1316 GMT.  
  
The chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany, along with facilities in Ireland and France, as it seeks to benefit from the European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU tries to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.  
  
It has not yet specified the exact size of the investment.  
  
Gelsinger told Reuters on Friday that the gap between what Germany had offered and what Intel needed was too big but he expected to reach an agreement, adding that his request was to be cost competitive.  
  
""We lost this industry to Asia, we have to be competitive if we're going to bring it back,"" he said, adding the overall investment for the site would be ""tens of billions of dollars"".

Amazon's $150 Billion Data Center Bet: Preparing for AI Boom and Market Domination,"ARTICLE TLDR: Amazon is investing a whopping $150 billion over 15 years to build data centers, anticipating a surge in demand for AI and digital services. This move aims to cement Amazon's lead in cloud services and enhance customer satisfaction. Additionally, Amazon is allocating over $1 billion this year to Nvidia's new Blackwell AI data center, further underlining its commitment to staying ahead in the tech race. With previous significant expenditures and strategic acquisitions, Amazon signals a bullish stance on profitability and market dominance.

"Realistically, how high can NVDA actually go at this point?","Currently Nvidia has a market cap of 2.62T, making it the 3rd largest market cap company in US. This follows Microsoft at 3.19T and Apple at 2.91T. If Nvidia were to become #1 in market cap, which looks like that's going to happen soon, that would be about 22% increase in its stock price. But beyond that, how realistic is it for this company to keep growing up to 4T market cap and beyond? Are the prospects seriously that good? To hit 4T, Nvidia stock would need to rise by another 50%. I just can't see how that is going to happen. How can Nvidia, which really is just a company that makes GPUs and drives, end up being more valuable than Microsoft, Apple, and Google in the long term? Nvidia has a fantastic business model and ridiculous profit margins, but it still seems unrealistic to me for it's share price to keep growing and growing to a record high market cap at this point.

My gut feels like there is far too much hype surrounding Nvidia's prospects and price should drop a fair bit. I think it's too risky to buy in now and that after the stock split we will start seeing a correction. Thoughts?

edit: Lol what's with the downvotes? Are we not allowed to have open discussions?"

"PSA: Do you beat yourself up after missing 'obvious' opportunities like Nvidia and AI? It's not just you, and it's called Hindsight Bias.","Before I knew about this psychological bias, I (and many others I know) thought we just had trouble 'biting the bullet' and investing in solid ideas. Thoughts like ""it was in front of me all along, but for some reason, I was too scared to put money into it"" were common. But the fact of the matter is, there are thousands of 'ideas' at any given moment, and the ones that actually make the news and become multi-baggers were **not** obvious in the past. So why do people feel this way, that they keep 'missing' out on obviously great investments? This is what is known as Hindsight Bias. 

Hindsight bias is, [according to Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hindsight-bias.asp), ""a psychological phenomenon that allows people to convince themselves after an event that they accurately predicted it before it happened. This can lead people to conclude that they can accurately predict other events. Hindsight bias is studied in behavioral economics because it is a common failing of individual investors.""

Why is knowing about hindsight bias significant? One, because if you believe that you **did** have proper insight and analytical skills to spot future success stories, then you might chase after any idea that looks good to to you **now**. However, unless you actually have proof that you were able to consistency find good ideas in that past that you simply didn't capitalize on, then you should not trust just your memory. Otherwise, one would pick potentially bad investments, and then **think** that they knew about other better ideas, repeating the cycle.

 It's also important to recognize this bias just for your state of mind. Enough people feel bad enough about missing multi-baggers like Amazon when they should be giving themselves a break. Saying you could have made made 100k if you only invested in some stock years ago is not the same as losing 100k, or we'd all be in the hole. So don't fret about the past and keep looking to the future. There are still plenty of opportunities out there, so best of luck investing! 

**Tldr:** Whatever happened in the past was not obvious, no matter how much it feels like it. Don't be overconfident that you can catch future ones but don't beat yourself up over missing opportunities either. Focus on the future!"
My 8 investing guidelines," 

I've been investing, trading, gambling for about 5 years now and I've done pretty much every rookie mistake there is. Sold winners from 2016 (Shop,Nvidia,AMD,Paypal) Lost fortunes on chasing that pennystock. Played and lost with trying to time the market, option trading.

I've been very active during these years reading and learning and you be surprised how often people get sucked in to the same stuff you self did once.

These are 8 guidelines that really helps me and that I've learn to appreciate over the years.

**1.Don't FOMO**

Yes we all heard it. You know that feeling when people are posting crazy gains on these new stocks, we all saw the EV hype. It's so so easy to get sucked in to thinking, if I just put in some money right now I can get 10-20-50% gains in a few days! It's already up 200% this month, surely it will keep going!?

This takes some real patience to keep your head cool and realize it could very well be overbought and the downside risk is just a lot higher than potential.

I've seen several sector hypes. We all remember the crypto bubble, the weed bubble and now lately the EV bubble. They all come and go and the more of these you been in from the start the easier it is to realize what's going on.

**2. Cut your losers and let your winners run**

Buying the dip is great when the market is down but if the fundamentals of the business is bad then usually this will just result in greater loss. On the flipside, if you have a few great picks and nothing fundamentally has changed and it keeps moving in the right direction then don't be afarid to keep adding.

**3. When the overall market is down, you buy**

No one can predict the market, don't waste time on it. When the overall market is down your stock is literally on sale. Usually every sector is down when the market is down, your stock and business has not changed one bit however, it's just a lower price now.

**4. Don't be afraid of corrections.**

Yeah it sucks seeing your portfolio down 20-30-40% but realize that stocks always go up, they seriously always do. Just keep your head down, keep buying and play that long game.

**5. Small amounts can turn into big profits down the line**

When you get really into investing you seriously start rethinking your life. That new OLED 77 inch? Only 2k right? What do you think that 2000 could be in 10 years? You just want to put every damn penny you got in the stock market because compounding interests are just too good to pass up. So just rethink if really need that new thing now or if it could wait.

**6. If the company keeps growing, why sell?**

Taking profit is good however not always the best thing to do. If the stock you have keeps growing and keeps crushing earnings. Why should you sell? Why just not keep it for years, it sure can be tempting but are you sure that money could be spent better elsewhere when it's easily growing in your winning stock.

**7, Never regret that you didn't buy more**

We all been here. Why the hell didn't I buy more of Amazon? Why didn't I just put my whole paycheck in this stock!?

You can never do this. It won't lead to anything, you can't fix it and you honestly did the best decisions at the time with the information you had. Realize that at the time this was the best decision, ofcourse hindsight it looks like you could have done a better decision.

**8. Don't sell and buy in again to time a correction**

This is very hard and with the momentum some growth stocks have these days you might just end up loosing more of that profit even if there is a slight correction. Just keep the money in and stop worrying."
Tech Stocks Are Absurdly Cheap Now: putting my money where my mouth is,"Buckle in.

Investing isn't easy, and yet people are--and always will--try to act like it is. Just like every other period in stock market history, retail 'investors' are being lazy and emotional and valuing businesses based off the direction their prices are heading rather than long term fundamentals. Volatility is the price you pay for performance. Thinking it's time to sell tech and buy Kellogg, with corporate profits RISING, will get you into deep trouble. 

No, being a good investor has absolutely nothing to do with being 'contrarian'. It just so happens that retail is too lazy and emotional to notice that prices tend to head fake away from where people should be buying at any given timeframe. Sometimes these head fakes point to different asset classes, other times to different assets within any given class. 

Right now, it's both. 

People think tech is in 2001 territory strictly because of price action, when we are in literally the opposite place outside a handful of overvalued and overhyped names; and people think bond yields are becoming attractive, when bonds are in the worst bear market in years (though this could change at any time considering the overreaction we've seen in Fed rate predictions). **This is precisely when you should be buying reasonably priced tech with strong cash flows, pricing power, quality earnings growth, barriers to entry (either a difficult industry to break into or an outright moat, which is very rare and hard to predict but** ***Facebook has one*****), network effects, and demand inelasticity.** Your stocks don't have to have all of these elements, but the more, the merrier. 

**\*\*\***

**Here's some oversimplified but VERY true deductive reasoning that 99% of 'investors' fail to heed:**

\-Companies with higher earnings growth deserve higher valuations  
\-Companies with better pricing power deserve higher valuations  
\-Companies with higher quality earnings growth deserve higher valuations  
\-Netflix and Facebook are still growth companies, their earnings quality is only improving, and they have IMMENSE pricing power that they've only begun to tap into  
\-Proctor & Gamble has a 40% higher relative valuation than Netflix  
\-CAMPBELL'S SOUP has a higher valuation than Facebook  
\-So-called 'investors' firmly believe that staples are the place to be right now, because 'interest rates' and 'inflation'. 

**Okay...**

\-Corporate profits drive stock prices--literally in lock step--over the long run  
\-Inflation is good for corporate profits  
\-Inflation requires higher interest rates  
\-Higher interest rates are a headwind for stocks  
\-Higher interest rates ARE A LITERAL CATASTROPHE FOR BONDS  
\-Holding cash *is basically taking a financial gun and pointing it at your face and pulling the trigger*  
\-The answer is to own quality assets, which are companies with strong cash flows, moats, network effects, etc.

**Millions of retail investors are absolutely convinced that tech is overvalued--but it's not because of poor fundamentals. Honestly, it's not even because of inflation, interested rates, or Ukraine. It's simply because prices are going down.** Do yourself a favor. Look at sentiment from one year ago today. Facebook to $600 was a done deal. Netflix was overpriced, and I wouldn't have bought it at near $700, but if anyone thought we would be below $230, we'd be minting new billionaires by the second because of their OTM puts. Amazon is more underpriced than I've maybe ever seen based off what we can easily see (the market has never understood Amazon, and AWS ALONE is clearly a multitrillion dollar valuation by 2030). 

**FACTS:**

\-**Amazon** PE is lowest ever while its future core businesses--AWS and ads (they are doing more ad revenue than YOUTUBE now, and AWS brings in more profit than any business line now, so if you think Amazon is a retail business you should be buying index funds...)--are growing at 40% or more.   
\-**Facebook** PE is lowest ever--last time this happened was three years ago, their stock price crashed to $131, and with this incredible overreaction they're STILL up 54% since then.   
\-And now to my favorite part: **Netflix** is at its lowest valuation since the 2000s and perhaps ever--who cares before then, it wasn't Netflix, it was a frickin' mail-order DVD company. Its PEG is .84. Its earnings have plateaued on SEVERAL occasions only to leap, over and over again. Just like Facebook, they were bound to hit a plateau for their core use base at some point. But if you think that means they're done growing out earnings--not to mention expanding other business lines, like Amazon did with AWS and ads, and Microsoft did with Azure--you need to ask yourself whether you have enough knowledge and experience here. 

In a way, investing really isn't that hard. **You just have to actually buy businesses and not obsess over the value of your portfolio every day**. If you do that, you're smart enough to see that tech could fall another 30% right now--and it would only present an even better buying opportunity with even more upside. As Buffett said after 2008, he might've been early, but he still got rich. And trust me, buying now might be early, but it will be INSANELY lucrative. 

SO SO SO many companies are just dirt cheap. People think DropBox is a shitty cloud business, when its top line is growing double digits and they're priced like Campbell's f'kn Soup. People think GoPro is a shitty camera business when it has begun adding software with INCREDIBLE margins and is growing rapidly again. Upstart is literally the only company in the market with the triple crown--triple digit growth, massively profitable, and BUYING BACK STOCK--yet its price was cut by 80%. There are just so many tech companies getting caught up in this indiscriminate selling, as if they're DoorDash or Rivian or Nikola or Snowflake, or any of the incredibly overpriced businesses, good or bad, that deserved to be cut in half.  

People calling this tech bubble 2.0 are either too young to understand what the tech bubble was, or too stupid to understand what it was. This is the literal opposite of the tech bubble. We have companies with tens of billions in FCF being repriced as if they're going out of business. Earnings are GROWING. We are in a BOOM cycle--IN TECH. You are being fooled--AGAIN. During the tech bubble, it's not that companies weren't making money...**THEY WEREN'T EVEN BRINGING IN REVENUE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE?** Not even the most overvalued companies today (aside from Rivian and Nikola) can attest to such an atrocity. 

I pity the people who need to see instant green in their portfolios, and I hope to see your sea of !Remind Me! posts for five to ten years from now. **For those of you who take anything away from this post, here's putting my money where my mouth is:**

Here's my portfolio weighted by notional impact--i.e. ITM calls carry more leverage despite moving the same amount as 100 shares of a stock, or ATM short puts I've written to buy at a lower cost basis or just hold the premium. (**I plan on opening a Netflix position at some point soon.**)

**$UPST:** **16.9%** (Pretty much the perfect stock: AI lending company that's barely unaffected by rates and loan origination volume; already profitable by a mile; reinvesting capital into massive TAMs; and already has permission from the board to buy back stock. Hope you don't judge a stock by its PE because that's how you miss pretty much every single winner, from Amazon to Salesforce to Netflix.)  
**$CIM:** **7.7%** (Retracing like a tech stock right now with fortress balance sheet and 12% dividend yield--and climbing. Chimera did even better following the pandemic after cutting its dividend yield, which made for the perfect time to buy.)  
**$OSTK:** **7.54%** (Retail furniture business that's stealing market share from Wayfair and growing rapidly yet with a stock price selling as if it's going out of business--oh yeah, and they've got Medici Ventures, which is priced at zero.)  
**$Z: 6.56%** (Vertically integrated media business of which people seem to have zero understanding. It's literally in the best shape it's ever been: shed of its worst business segment and raising capital from home inventory; growing at over 20%; and selling at a 75%+ discount...yet people hate it infinitely more than when it was up near $200...LOL)  
**$AMZN: 5.97%** (Enough said above. This is a multitrillion dollar business that checks every box listed above selling at less than half its true value.)   
**$APPS:** **5.25%** (Growing triple digits, profitable, and with insane barriers to entry--not quite Upstart, but this is a 5x play.)  
**$URI:** **5.12%** (Picks and shovels play for infrastructure boom ahead. Someone will pass a version of build back better, and this company is a gem even without government subsidy. Also, United Rentals helps balance out my insanely tech-weighted portfolio just a tad bit, though that's not at all why I bought it--because I could care less how much money I lose in the short term to maximize long term gains.)  
**$FB:** **5.2%** (The greatest network company of all time--a company whose business model will never be repeated--is trading at a multiple 7% lower than the Campbell f'kin Soup Company. Enough said.)  
**$CLSK:** **4.71%** (One of the fastest growing companies in the world; already profitable; ESG sustainable Bitcoin miner; QUADRUPLE DIGIT GROWTH on the top line; trading at a SINGLE DIGIT forward PE--crashing as if both they and Bitcoin are going to zero.)  
**$STNE:** **4.37%** (A big boo-boo in their long book and concerns about the Brazilian economy are apparently enough to crash the stock over 90%. Like several other stocks on this list, earnings give a HUGE temporary boost because of how incredibly strong they are, only to watch the gains wither away because of indiscriminate selling in the tech space.)  
**$AMAT: 3.14%** (Picks and shovels play for the semiconductor bull market that will last for decades to come. Probably the only company on this list that I'd call fairly valued, but it's such a great company it's worth every penny.)  
**$PLTR: 3.09%** (It's apparently fun to hate Palantir because it was a meme stock. But if you can do math, 30% compound interest for 10 years does not a meme stock make. Probably the only stock on this list that I might even call *over*priced, but I also think it's worth every penny with a smaller position.)  
**$AMD: 2.97%** (Trading as if China is going to invade, tear down TSM, collapse the market for chips, and send interest rates to 50%. Beyond idiotically cheap.)  
**$MU: 2.85%** (Micron's pricing power is unmatched in this industry. Very few companies do what they do and none do it as well--and they're trading for pennies on the dollar.)  
**$DBX: 2.66%** (Apparently it's cool to hate Drew Houston? I don't know, but in addition to what was mentioned above, this company is set to buy back half it's MFing float. Like, are you kidding me?)  
**$NVDA: 2.61%** (Only reason I don't have a bigger allocation is because NVIDIA puts my total semi allocation at around 9%. I also owned Intel for a hot second before I rolled it into other plays. Think The whole space is going to continue to skyrocket, but no one has the creativity or talent that NVIDIA does.)  
**$BNTX: 2.6%** (The market thinks that this company stumbled upon vaccines, that covid is ending tomorrow, and that they have no other pipeline. The reality is that BioNTech is set to sell billions more in vaccines for a long time coming, and all of this is an incredibly massive tailwind to their rare diseases pipeline.)  
**$WBD: 2.22%** (It's always funny when some jackoff at BoA comes out with a report about how the merger between Discovery and Warner Brothers will create synergies that make this a $45 stock--6 months after the deal is announced. The stock rocketed above $30, then was indiscriminately sold off back to where it started--for no reason. The market is so efficient.)  
**$GPRO: 2.2%** (As mentioned above, this has become a software company with total control over its market and prices. 96% of action cameras in America are GoPros. The recurring revenue on that software makes this at least a $30 stock. But nobody wants to own it because RemEmBEr tHat TiME WheN iT SolD OfF?)  
**$NOK: 2.1%** (5G is them and some other guy. Enough said.)  
**$CRM: 1.81%** (This company does not stop growing. One of the best companies in the world and there is no end in sight. Personally think the Slack purchase is being totally swept under the rug. It's just that time of the cycle when you're supposed to doubt Benioff.)  
**$NLST: 1.33%** (Very unknown memory company with massive lawsuits against a bevy of huge companies and great prospects outside those lawsuits. They settled the lawsuit with SK Hynix and still have pending cases for patent infringement against the likes of Samsung, Micron, and Google--all of which are entirely legitimate.)  
**$AMRS: 0.8%** (A deep future play for molecules-as-a-function. This one is very nuanced and I'm getting tired of writing. You'd have to look into this one yourself to truly understand the importance of synthetic, sustainable molecules used in the place of limited and/or endangered organics at far cheaper prices across the cost spectrum.)  
**$SFT: 0.29%** (Kind of a random little lottery bet on a company with a market cap lower than its fourth quarter revenue alone. But with no path to profitability in sight, that's all it is: a lottery ticket with a VERY small amount of AUM allocated.) 

*It's not possible to create a perfect weighting with options in your portfolio, especially short puts, but I've done the best I can. For example, notionally, I could be tied to even more* ***Upstart*** *than I've represented here. But Upstart would have to be ITM across three separate strikes (70, 80, and 100) by January 2023, which nobody can predict. (What I can say is that anything under $100 is DIRT cheap for Upstart, so I'm more than happy to own it at about $51, $55, and $66, which would be the breakeven prices at each strike, respectively, when including the outrageous premium I was paid for writing these puts.) I split the notional values of being assigned each put in half to represent the fact that Upstart is currently ITM for my 100 puts, ATM for the 80, and OTM for 70. Arbitrary, but so is anything in this case, even if you'd use Black Scholes somehow.*"
Biden to hit China with broader curbs on U.S. chip and tool exports,"The Biden administration plans next month to broaden curbs on U.S shipments to China of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence and chipmaking tools, several people familiar with the matter said. The Commerce Department intends to publish new regulations based on restrictions communicated in letters earlier this year to three U.S. companies — KLA, Lam Research and Applied Materials, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The plan for new rules has not been previously reported. The letters, which the companies publicly acknowledged, forbade them from exporting chipmaking equipment to Chinese factories that produce advanced semiconductors with sub-14 nanometer processes unless the sellers obtain Commerce Department licenses. The rules would also codify restrictions in Commerce Department letters sent to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices last month instructing them to halt shipments of several artificial intelligence computing chips to China unless they obtain licenses.

So-called “is informed” letters allow the Commerce Department to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to put controls in place quickly, but the letters only apply to the companies that receive them. Turning the letters into rules would broaden their reach and could subject other U.S. companies producing similar technology to the restrictions. The regulations could potentially apply to companies trying to challenge Nvidia and AMD’s dominance in artificial intelligence chips. Intel and startups like Cerebras Systems are targeting the same advanced computing markets. Intel said it is closely monitoring the situation, while Cerebras declined to comment.

One source said the rules could also impose license requirements on shipments to China of products that contain the targeted chips. Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer make data center servers that contain Nvidia’s A100 chip. Dell and HPE said they were monitoring the situation, while Super Micro Computer did not respond to a request for comment.

Here are the major factors contributing to a very possible market correction soon,"I am not a market expert but I have been observing red flags piling up recently and it’s wise to pay close attention to them as they point to a near market correction including: 

**Low market breadth and divergence:** there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining, and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high. 

**Overbought stocks:** such as AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast. This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way, hence the overbought flag. 

**Reduced volumes:** signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking. For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3.7 billion. Incidentally this index tracks 2,000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7.3% thus far. 

**Major trend line broken:** for the second time in less than one month the S&P 500 has dipped under its major trend line. The first time on May 18th, it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations. Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop. 

Obviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics, but they don’t explain the reasons behind such changes. We have to look at economic news to identify causes including: 

**Peaking economic recovery:** several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery. For example, both the services PMI 64.6 vs 65.2 vs 64.8 (actual, forecast, previous) and ISM 60.1% vs 63.3% vs 64.0% reports for June show a declining rate of expansion. Also, industrial production is showing similar pattern 0.4% vs 0.6% vs 0.7%.

**Mixed Q2 banking results:** also point to the same issue above. While the overall figures are up, the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness. 

**Declining consumer sentiment:** while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85.5 to 80.8. The main driver behind this is inflation.  

**Inflation rising:** the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the “base effect” and some temporary supply constraints. Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months. Now it’s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI (the Fed’s favorite metric) registering 0.9%, the highest increase since 2008.

Furthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED’s 2% threshold by a wide margin. 

**Reemergence of a new variant:**  the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world. While its effect in the US might be limited, a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general, hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up. 

**Bond yields going down:** usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists. Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March. Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it. Remember, the inverse relation between bonds and yields. 

**China’s Crack on tech:** has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out. 

All of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don’t play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out. 

It’s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers. 

A crash on the other hand is a much larger event that’s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop. 

There are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repo facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates. 

Massive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term. 

Some argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like. Equities and bonds expert Ray Dalio explains this process in his most recent video on YouTube."
Cathie Wood calls Nvidia stock 'overpriced' after missing 2023 rally,"Cathie Wood isn't buying the artificial intelligence hype at Nvidia (NVDA).  
  
The founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced.  


Nvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday.  
  
  
Wood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.  
It hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading session.  
With the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) now up more than 2.5% in the last five days, Wood argues there are going to be other winners in the AI space outside of Nvidia.  
""Other companies with visionary leaders, strong global distribution and, perhaps most important, large-high-quality pools of proprietary data should be big #AI winners, with revenues and earnings surprising significantly on the high side of expectations during the years ahead,"" Wood tweeted.  
There will be ""dozens"" of AI winners, according to Wood. But the one that stands out to Ark, as it often does, is Tesla (TSLA).  
Wood argues that at six times revenue, Tesla stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's current 25 times revenue valuation.  
""(Tesla) is the most obvious beneficiary of the recent breakthroughs in #AI, as it aims for an $8-10 trillion revenue TAM in autonomous mobility by 2030,"" Wood wrote.  
With several positive headlines in the news of late including a growing relationship in China, Tesla shares are up more than 7% amid the broader tech rally.

  
Wood's Nvidia comments come as her flagship ETF, the Ark Innovation Fund (ARKK), has struggled to return to its pandemic dominance. The ETF skyrocketed during the risk-on bull market of 2020 with high-flying pandemic darlings like Tesla, Zoom (ZM), and even Nvidia contributing to gains.  
But as the Federal Reserve enacted its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in four decades, risky bets became less popular with investors. Some of Ark's top holdings, such as Zoom, Roku (ROKU), and Coinbase (COIN) are well off their pandemic highs.  
The fund itself lost more than $1 billion in market cap in 2022 with shares falling nearly 67%."
Who's buying tomorrow?,"Stocks are getting destroyed in after hours, almost everything is in deep discount, MSFT is in $270's, Apple at $159, Google is close to below it's pre-earnings 2 weeks ago, AMD and Nvidia are close to their 6 month low. What is everyone's play tomorrow? Will you wait out another week? A month?

Costco and Home depot are also are on sale."
When will we stop hearing “Nasdaq didn’t recover for 15 years”?,"To start with, I love this sub. Most of the people are super nice and helpful. Having said that, does anyone else think there’s a lot of fear mongering here as well?

Every now and then there are comments like “If you had bought QQQ in 2000 you wouldn’t have recovered for 15 years”. The same person in another thread comments “Past return doesn’t indicate the future bro”. Sooo which one is it?
Can’t we agree 2000 was a totally different time than 2022? It has been over 20 years since the crash but fear mongering is still there. 

Today, 60% of QQQ consists of companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, Costco and more such. Are these companies similar to what we had in 2000? I don’t think so. Also how would I l know, I was 5 at that time.

What do you guys think?"
Investing in Costco today is actually betting against it,"Costco has been the best single holding in my portfolio and after 10 years and \~1000% gains, I liquidated my holdings of Costco when it crossed $900 last week. To be clear, Costco is going to have a fantastic report today - we know this because they already release monthly sales and Costco has continued its industry leading performance, and the limited revenue growth projections of 1% are largely due to the fact that the comparable YoY quarter is a week shorter. Moreover, on an annual basis, Costco is probably one of the only companies out there that hasn't had a single losing year over the last decade. I'm also a huge Costco shopper that continues to be an addict in throwing more spend in, despite my perception that many of Costco's core staples aren't as good of a deal as they used to be. 

Revenue has improved 5%+ every year. More impressively, so has net margin, improving 50% from \~2% to 3% over the same time period. I believe the bull case that both of these trends will continue at very little risk. Costco has an amazing team to select locations and proof of international scale. It also has room to continue to steadily improve margins through its supply chain, pricing, product mix, membership price increases, and eCommerce penetration. 

But what used to be a bull case for this stock has now become bull fantasy. The arguments for Costco popping to $1000 boil down to:

1) Costco stock has always been expensive and PE doesn't matter

2) Stock split = $$$  

3) My local Costco has long lines 

Yes, Costco stock has always commanded a premium above industry. And every single quarter, every Costco bear that has said ""Costco stock is too expensive"" has been slapped in the face and proven wrong. Personally, I think Costco deserves tech-stock like valuations and a multiple of the rest of the industry. This year has been different. Costco PE ratio has eclipsed Nvidia, and is now above 55; Costco is now more expensive than it's ever been relative to its earnings by an enormous margin. For reference, if Costco instantly doubled in size right now and paid out 100% of its profits in dividends in perpetuity, it's yield would still be a little smaller than the 10Y treasury. 

A PE ratio above 50 means quite simply that you are investing in the company because you are confident earnings will explosively grow in the next few years. I am betting Costco is going to continue to be Costco - an amazingly well run company that takes almost no risk in continuing to improve over time, resulting in fantastic high single digit eps growth. The bull case now is essentially betting that Costco isn't going to be Costco, but rather something entirely different in 5 years. Those betting on Costco eclipsing $1000 after earnings today are betting that Costco will have an unprecedented pop on the quarterly report (there has never been a +10% before) and a 60+ TTM PE ratio. At some point, optimistic becomes insanity and we're there already. 

And there are downside factors to consider too. If revenue has already been largely reported, the report really centers around margin and comments on future growth. 

- 5-10% of Costco's growth has been from gold bars, which will likely be dilutive to margin (2% margin on these vs a typical 10-15%) 

- Gas prices going down isn't good for Costco

- As Costco expands it membership base, share of wallet, and portfolio of products, it becomes increasingly tied to US macroeconomic conditions simply as a function of being a more meaningful representation of total consumer spend 

- Membership price increases were smaller than some desired and haven't fully taken effect 

- Costco door scanners were likely implemented after tests proved they were accretive in the short run for margin due to improved shrinkage and folks buying more memberships; but this isn't like Netflix where each membership increase is just pure margin - the story on basket sizes, renewal impacts, and potential competitive dynamics is likely a little more murky, and will take longer to play out given annual vs. monthly renewals

- Costco lines consistently being long everywhere quarter after quarter might be a hindrance and capacity constraint vs not 

- eCommerce margins are still unclear along with the impact of Instacart on memberships"
NVDA jumps 8% after CEO comments but falls 12% after quarterly report?,"So let me get this straight. After a bombastic quarterly report that may contain a faint hint towards a slight slow down the stock crashes and loses 12%. But when the CEO makes a side comment that they are actually doing great it goes back up 8%?

Is this a meme stock now? Are we back into the Elon Musk market manipulation territory again or what the heck is going on? I, genuinely, don't get it."
Nvidia board member dumps $48 million more in stock amid monster rally,"Harvey Jones, who has been on the board since 1993, has unloaded more than $76 million worth of Nvidia shares so far this month.

A longtime board member at Nvidia Corp. dumped more than $48 million worth of the chip maker’s shares earlier this week, cashing in on the stock’s recent surge.  
  
Harvey Jones, who has been on the Nvidia NVDA, -0.80% board since 1993, sold nearly 120,000 shares of the company Tuesday at prices between $400 and $408.51, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made public Wednesday. He pocketed $48.3 million through the transaction, which took place with shares that he held in his living trust.

Jones, who is also the managing partner of private-investment entity Square Wave Ventures, holds 676,396 shares of Nvidia through the trust after Tuesday’s activity. He owns another 137,934 shares directly.  


The latest transaction by Jones follows a move by the Nvidia director to unload 70,205 shares at an average price of $405 on June 2, according to a filing from earlier in the month. He made over $28 million through that earlier burst of selling.  
  
Jones is reducing his Nvidia holdings as the stock has seen a massive run up so far this year, rising nearly 200% over that span. Nvidia recently became just the seventh U.S. public company to finish out a trading session with a market capitalization above $1 trillion, and it’s seen as a huge beneficiary of the growing fascination with artificial-intelligence technology.

DD on Corsair ($CRSR),"  

***Full disclosure, I am a shareholder so my opinions can be biased.***

This is not financial advice but I have tried to do some DD on this so please read to the end. I posted this to WSB yesterday and it didnt get much traction so i'm hoping more people here will find it useful. 

For those of you who might not know what Corsair is, they are a computer parts and peripherals company founded in 1994 that went public in September of 2020. If you have a desktop PC, keyboard, mouse, or are a streamer, chances are you have seen their logo. Corsair Gaming ($CRSR) reports earnings this coming week on Tuesday. In light of that, I have put together a few insights that some of you may find interesting.

**Earnings. Tuesday February 9th**

First, a look at the previous quarter’s earnings (Q3 2020)

&#x200B;

**Q3 2020 Highlights**

\- Net revenue was $457.1 million, an **increase of 60.7%** year over year

\- Gamer and creator peripherals net revenue was $161.6 million, an **increase of 128.8%** year over year

\- Gross profit was $129.9 million, an **increase of 112.4%** year over year

\- Gross margin was 28%, an **increase of 680 bps** (that’s 6.8%)

\- Gamer and creator peripherals segment gross profit was $60 million, an **increase of 200.8%** year over year

\- Gaming components and systems segment gross profit was $67.9 million, an increase of 68.7% year over year

\- Operating income was $49.7 million, an **increase of 353.6%** year-over-year

\- Adjusted operating income was $61.4 million, an **increase of 193.7%** year-over-year

\- Net income was $36.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.02 per diluted share

\- **Adjusted net income was $48.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, an increase of 384.0% year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $10.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.**

**-** Adjusted EBITDA was $63.7 million, an **increase of 184.9%** year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.9%, an **improvement of 610 bps** year-over-year

**Q3 Earnings Call Highlights (quotes from the call)**

\- “This last quarter was one with very strong demand, with many major retailers running out of stock of our gear. Our stock situation has gotten better but only a small part of Q3 revenue came from restocking shelves, **with most gear selling as soon as they hit the shelves**.”

\- “We also recently launched two new microphones under our Elgato brand, Wave 1 and Wave 3, **which were sold out within the first few days of launch**.”

&#x200B;

**Catalysts for Growth**

According to data released by the International Data Corporation (IDC),

\- Global gaming PC shipments are expected to jump by 25% by 2024, while **global shipments of gaming laptops, desktop PCs, and monitors jumped 16.2% year over year in 2020 with December 2020 seeing the highest sales of PC components and peripherals on record**.

**-** IDC predicts 2021 to witness a real surge in gaming PCs as new graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD and Intel are expected to drive prices down and performance up.

**- Global gaming PC sales revenue has jumped 60% in the past 5 years.** In 2015 the global gaming PC market reached $24.6 billion in revenue, which has increased to $39.2 billion in 2020. High end gaming computers represent the largest revenue stream in 2020 at $18.5 billion or 47% of combined profits in 2020

\- Not only will Corsair be able to capitalize on a gaming PC super cycle upgrade with new GPUs but on October 22, 2020, Corsair announced the launch of their first officially licensed headset for Microsoft Xbox. Corsair will also be able to capitalize on the Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox console super cycle using their headsets and Scuf Gaming controllers for consoles. Corsair currently holds patents on several console controllers, Microsoft has licensed these patents to create the Xbox Elite Controller.

\- According to Corsair

\- There were 2.6 billion gamers (across all platforms) as of 2019

\- 11% of leisure time in the US is spent on gaming

\- 12 billion hours of gaming content was streamed in 2019

\- 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming content on streaming platforms

\- Corsair will be able to capture this enormous rise in streaming using their Elgato line of products which enhance the ability of content creators to stream.

&#x200B;

**Market Share**

\- Pulled from Corsairs S-1 filing, they currently command over **18% of the US market share in gaming peripherals and nearly 42% of the gaming PC components market share**. This will allow them to capture a substantial portion of revenues from the global gaming peripherals market size which is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate **(CAGR) of 10.4**% from 2020 to 2025 according to grand view research.

**- Ranking of Corsair’s Total US Market Share by Product:**

**-** Keyboards: 2nd

\- Mice: 3rd

\- Headsets: 4th

\- Streaming Peripherals: 2nd

\- Performance Controllers: 2nd 

\- Memory: 1st 

\- Cases: 1st 

\- Power Supply Units: 1st 

\- Cooling Solutions: 1st 

**-** Releases of gaming content with ever-higher graphical requirements will drive consumers to upgrade their components and subsequently their peripherals as well. 

\- **Corsair gaming is an ecosystem of products with a strong and recognizable brand which creates extreme brand loyalty amongst its customers.** This is more of a personal opinion but through my own experience and observation, it seems that when a customer goes to upgrade 1 component from Corsair, several hundred dollars later they come out the other side purchasing a number of internal PC components and have upgraded all of their peripherals (keyboard and mouse), but this is anecdotal.

&#x200B;

**Q4 Earnings & Beyond** (released before the bell on Tuesday February 9th).

These are predictions and can obviously be taken with a grain of salt but I hope you can understand my rationale

\- I believe we will see a huge beat on Tuesday’s earnings release. This will be led by the compounding effects of the pandemic stay at home orders along-side an extremely strong holiday season. According to the site: Super Data, sales of digital games experienced a record number at $12 billion in December alone. This was the highest monthly revenue on record with PC games taking the lion’s share of this with a year over year revenue jump of 40% thanks to Cyberpunk 2077. This extremely high demand for PC games will drive the upgrading cycle and demand for Corsairs PC components and their peripherals. 

\- I also believe that Corsair is a long term hold with substantial growth potential as the adoption of gaming grows.

&#x200B;

**Competitor Comparison**

**-** Corsair is frequently compared to Logitech. 

\- Logitech currently has a market cap of $18.63 billion, Corsair has a market cap of $4.15 billion.

\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $2.9 billion, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $1.65 billion.

\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $300 million, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $192 million.

\- Logitech currently has 169 million shares outstanding with a float of 162 million shares (6% is shorted), Corsair currently has 92 million shares outstanding with a 25 million share float (24% is shorted)


**I believe Corsair is severely undervalued**"
"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021.

# **Stocks could be volatile in week ahead amid turbulence from cryptocurrency - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/stocks-could-be-volatile-in-week-ahead-amid-turbulence-from-cryptocurrency.html)**
*****
> The trading pattern of the past two weeks – particularly alongside cryptocurrency’s movements – suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead.
*****
> Investors are watching the wild swings in b/itcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 were lower in the past week, but Nasdaq was slightly higher, helped by a positive move in tech, as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix.
*****
> A steep plunge in b/itcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week. The U.S. also called for stricter compliance with the IRS. Further, on Friday, China said it would crack down on b/itcoin mining and trading.
*****
> “What’s interesting is the market is being bullied around by where b/itcoin goes,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. B/itcoin plunged by as much as 30% on Wednesday, to about $30,000. Though it recovered to above $42,000, it slid again on Friday.
*****
> The cryptocurrency was down about 9% late Friday, hovering around $36,000, according to Coin Metrics.
*****
> “B/itcoin is a poster child for risk appetite,” said Boockvar. “It tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground, if we’re getting dragged along by b/itcoin.”
*****
> There is some key data in the week ahead. Consumer confidence, home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday. Durable goods will be released Thursday, and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday.
*****
> But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data, which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.
*****
> “The key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers. The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance,” said Boockvar. “What will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers, is where the inflation expectations go.”
*****
> The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week, showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3% in April. The core PCE price index was up 1.8% year over year in March.
*****
> In the week ahead, earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers, like Best Buy, Costco and Nordstrom. NVIDIA and Dell also report.
*****
> # No correction yet
> As the market has chopped around this month, dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains.
*****
> Some strategists do not see a correction just yet, though pullbacks could continue.
*****
> “For me, my framework is we can only get a 10% correction when we have a liquidity set back, when we have a policy tightening,” said Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics. “In any of the little disturbances, we are getting about a 4% to 6% pullback.
*****
> Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies. “You should be in the cyclical parts of tech,” he said. Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound.
*****
> Tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week, gaining 0.1%, but semiconductors popped nearly 3%. Software was up 0.2%.
*****
> The Nasdaq was 0.3% higher on the week to 13,470, while the Dow was off a half percent at 34,207. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% to 4,155.
*****
> The best performing sector was real estate investment trusts, up 0.9%, followed by health care, up 0.7%. Biotech was higher on the week with the IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, up 1.1%.
*****
> “It wouldn’t shock me if we went straight back to new highs,” Knapp said. “Part of the reason I thought we would trade in a range, was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging.”
*****
> He said earnings for the S&P 500 are now expected to be up 7% more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began.
*****
> Knapp expects the Fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its Jackson Hole meeting in late summer, and that is the likely trigger for a correction. Back to World War II, he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy.
*****
> “Last cycle, we had eight of those,” he said. “Every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events.”
*****
> Knapp said it’s natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now. “It’s an uncertainty shock,” he said. “It will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it. The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic.”
*****
> Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending. But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks, since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit.
*****
> The b/itcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington, and the infrastructure spending could be positive. “The thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout,” he said, noting b/itcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spending.

> # Economic Surprise Index Tips Negative For The First Time In A Year

> While the overall trend of economic data has been for further improvement, things have slowed recently relative to expectations. In the charts below, we show the charts of the Citi Economic Surprise indices for the US, Emerging Markets, the Eurozone, and the entire world. Broadly speaking, positive readings indicate that economic data is coming in better than forecasts while negative readings indicate the opposite. Every region of the globe has pulled back over the past couple of months but for the most part, current readings remain at the high end of their historical ranges. In fact, the indices for Emerging Markets, Eurozone, and the whole globe all sit in the top 3% of all readings in their histories. The one place that is not the case is the US. Since last summer, the surprise index has been trending lower off of record levels, and just yesterday, it hit it tipped negative for the first time since June 2nd of last year.

> Lasting 248 trading days, this was the longest streak of consecutive positive readings in the index's history dating back to 2003. The only other streak that lasted nearly as long was a 189 day long one which came to an end in June 2018.

> # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&P 500 Month

> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

> In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%

> # May Manufacturing Starting Off Strong

> The first manufacturing data for May came out this morning with the release of the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. General business conditions remain at historically strong levels although there was some slowing in May as was expected. After hitting the highest level since October 2017 last month, it was expected to fall to 23.9 in May. The index did in fact decline, but only to 24.3. While lower, that is still around some of the strongest levels (excluding last month) in three years as more businesses continue to report improvements in business conditions than weakness.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-1.png))**

> Breadth in this month's report was pretty mixed; namely with regards to current conditions versus expectations. Every index is still showing an expansionary reading with particular strength out of the indices for the present situation. In fact, most of those indices still sit in the top decile of their historical range with a few like those for unfilled orders, delivery times, and prices even at or just off of record highs. But there were a handful that moved lower: delivery times, inventories, and number of employees.

> Regarding expectations, it was much harder to find an increase. Delivery times and technology spending were the only two of these indices to rise month over month. While many indices for expectations still sit at historically strong levels, there are more that are middling within their respective historical ranges. Overall, the report showed that New York area firms have seen a peak in optimism even as they continue to report strong conditions.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-Table.png))**

> Demand certainly appears to be one area without much in the way of weakness. New orders rose 2 points month over month to 28.9. That is the highest level in just over 15 years and the only other readings as high occurred throughout late 2003 to mid-2004. Those orders are making their way out the door at an increased rate too as shipments climbed to 29.7. That index has been making a vertical climb since the winter as it reached its highest level since August 2007.

> Despite this, NY area firms are not fulfilling orders fast enough. Last month saw the Unfilled Orders index rise by one of the largest amounts in a single month on record, and it continued to climb albeit by a much smaller 0.2 points in May. The only month on record with a higher reading in unfilled orders was September 2001. Inventories were one of the few current condition indices to fall in May, although the reading still indicated growth. In other words, those unfilled orders are not necessarily drawing down on inventory levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-2.png))**

> Supply chains are one of the main areas that are likely holding things back. Higher readings in the delivery times index mean that businesses are reporting that it takes longer for products to reach their destination. Even after falling 4.5 points in May off of the April record, the current level sits well above the prior record high of 16.2 from March 2018.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-3.png))**

> In addition to taking longer for products to get to where they are going, the price point is on the rise. Both indices for prices paid and received rose to record highs in May. In fact, over the past two months, there has not been a single respondent to have reported a decrease in prices paid. That is the first time that has occurred since February and March 2012.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-4.png))**

> Last week saw a blockbuster job openings report and the Empire Fed survey is showing a similar willingness to take on more workers. The current conditions index for the number of employees continues to show that businesses are on net increasing their workforce, though at a slowed pace from April. Additionally, the index is at a much less elevated part of its range (the 81st percentile) relative to other indices within the report, but the much more elevated reading in expectations (98th percentile) would indicate the businesses would like to take on far more workers. That is, there appears to be a bit of a disconnect between the actual number of new hires and businesses' expectations to take on more workers. Potentially as a result of an inability to hire enough workers, the average workweek has continued to climb. At 18.7, the index is at its highest level in a decade.

> # Homebuilder Sentiment Holds Steady

> Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

> The national average on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage currently sits around 3.06%, little changed over the past month. Homebuilder sentiment as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index similarly went unchanged in May staying at 83. Although it has been six months since the record high of 90 without much of a push back up to those record levels, homebuilder sentiment continues to come in well above anything observed prior to the pandemic. Commentary from the NAHB noted that the strong reading on homebuilder confidence is thanks to the low housing inventories, low rates, and strong demand, despite the headwinds of rising costs. While that could have played into the small decline in traffic, future sales did tick higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-HL.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Table.png))**

> Whereas the headline number was flat on the month, readings based on each region saw much more variety. By far the largest move was for the Northeast. Since running back up to the record high back in February, homebuilder sentiment in the Northeast has fallen for three straight months and is now at the lowest level since January. The decline in sentiment in the Northeast is relatively recent. Whereas the region tied its record high earlier this year, the other regions all peaked out in the fall. For the Midwest, the declines have kept coming with 3 point declines in each of the past three months alone. The West and South, on the other hand, have found some respite. The South has ticked higher by 2 points in back-to-back months as it reached the highest level since December. Meanwhile, the West was unchanged at 91 in May.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Region.png))**

> As for homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) had been trading in overbought territory throughout most of the spring but in the past couple of weeks, it has come back down to Earth. Last Wednesday, ITB successfully tested its 50-DMA with a small bounce at the tail end of the week. So far today, it has turned lower alongside the broader market with a 1.35% decline. While that means Friday's close marks a lower high, for the time being, the uptrend is still intact.

> # Increased Caution Across Sentiment Indicators

> The S&P 500 has been holding up at its 50-DMA in the past week while more speculative areas of the market (i.e. crypto) have experienced wild swings. As a result, sentiment on the part of individual investors has not seen much of a move. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment was little changed this week climbing half of one percentage point to 37%. Although that was not a large move in the past week, sentiment has taken a big hit over the past month having fallen from well above 50%. In spite of that big drop and even though sentiment is around the lowest levels of the past half-year, the current sentiment level is within one percentage point of the historical average. In other words, optimism is low versus recent history but is very much middling from a longer term perspective.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull.png))**

> Meanwhile, bearish sentiment fell 0.7 percentage points to 26.3%. Unlike bullish sentiment, that is a bit lower than the historical average of 30.5%

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Those corresponding moves meant the bull-bear spread climbed to 10.7 from 9.5 the prior week. Excluding last week, that is still one of the lowest readings since February.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

> Neutral sentiment has been the star of the show recently. The gain this week was tiny at only 0.2 percentage points, but nonetheless, it marked the fifth consecutive week in which neutral sentiment has risen. At 36.7%, it is now at the highest level since the second week of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> The Investors Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers took a less optimistic tone this week as bullish sentiment fell 4.1 percentage points to a ten-week low of 54.5%. Bearish sentiment was unchanged at the highest level since the end of March. The survey also questions respondents on whether or not they expect a correction. That reading rose 4.1 percentage points to 28.3% in the biggest one-week uptick since the last week of April when it rose 4.7 percentage points. That leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of March 10th. Before that, you would need to go back to September 23rd to find as high of a reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-II-Correction.png))**

> Another sentiment reading that has taken an even more dramatically negative tone lately has been the National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index. This index measures how exposed to equities managers are where readings of 200 would mean they are leveraged long, 100 would be fully invested long, 0 would be neutral, -100 is fully short, and -200 is leveraged short. This week saw the index fall another 2.65 points after a massive 40-point decline last week. That is the lowest level since last March and April of last year. Altogether, while sentiment still favors bulls, there has been a more cautious tone that has been reflected in managers reducing exposure to equities.

Nvidia Gets DOJ Subpoena in Escalating Antitrust Probe,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-03/nvidia-gets-doj-subpoena-in-escalating-antitrust-investigation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-03/nvidia-gets-doj-subpoena-in-escalating-antitrust-investigation)

The US Justice Department sent subpoenas to Nvidia Corp. and other companies as it seeks evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws, an escalation of its investigation into the dominant AI computing provider.

The DOJ, which had previously delivered questionnaires to companies, is now sending legally binding requests that oblige recipients to provide it with information, according to people familiar with the investigation. That takes the government probe a step closer to launching a formal complaint.

Antitrust officials are concerned that Nvidia is making it harder to switch to other suppliers and penalizes buyers that don’t exclusively use its artificial intelligence chips, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.

Nvidia shares, which suffered a record-setting rout on Monday, fell further in late trading after Bloomberg reported on the subpoenas. Still, the stock has more than doubled this year — fueled by explosive sales growth at the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker.

As part of the probe, which Bloomberg previously reported on in June, investigators have been contacting other technology companies to gather information. The DOJ’s San Francisco office is taking the lead running the inquiry, the people said.

Representatives for DOJ and Nvidia declined to comment."
Buying the Stock-Market Dip Is Backfiring This Year,"Share prices continue to plunge, denting a strategy that soared in popularity over the past decade

https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-the-stock-market-dip-is-backfiring-this-year-11664064845?mod=hp_lead_pos1

It is the worst year for buying the stock-market dip since the 1930s.  

Instead of rebounding after a tumble, stocks have continued to fall, burning investors who stepped in to buy shares on sale. The S&P 500 has dropped 1.2% on average this year in the week after a one-day loss of at least 1%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That is the biggest such decline since 1931.

The extended downturn is putting a dent in the popular buy-the-dip trade, a strategy in which many investors found great success after the last financial crisis and particularly during the lightning-fast pandemic recovery.

Major stock indexes hit dozens of continuous records, convincing many investors that any downturn would be short-lived—and an attractive opportunity to buy.

The trade has backfired during the monthslong downturn that has dragged the S&P 500 down 23% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest annual decline since 2008. The selloff accelerated last week when central banks around the world increased interest rates, driving sharp swings across stock, bond and currency markets. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell at least 4%, their fourth decline of at least 3% in five weeks.

Many investors have been wrestling with high inflation, a continuing war in Europe and the prospect of a recession. In the days ahead, fresh data on consumer spending and confidence will provide clues on how high prices are shaping Americans’ behavior and the extent to which the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases are rippling through the economy. 

The volatility has been stomach-churning for many investors as they have watched their portfolios steadily decline in value week after week. 

“I’ve really been taking a beating,” said Santi Tafarella, a 58-year-old community-college professor in the Lancaster, Calif., area. “I’m uncomfortable.” 

Mr. Tafarella said he has been buying the dip in the stock market—including on Friday—only to see his positions quickly sour. 

Other investors said they are hanging on and haven’t yet backed away from buying the dip, trying to keep a steady hand and an eye on long-term returns. At least one trend has persevered: Individual investors have tended to buy more shares of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds on days when the S&P 500 is down than when it is rising, according to Vanda Research. 

***That includes Sept. 13, when the S&P 500 tumbled 4.3% in its sharpest one-day fall since 2020. Individual investors bought more than $2 billion of U.S. shares and exchange-traded funds that day, the second-highest total of the year.*** They bought $395 million of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust alone that day, the highest one-day amount of 2022. 

U.S. households have poured more money into U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs than they have pulled out for the year. U.S. funds have drawn $89 billion of net inflows in 2022, according to EPFR Global data analyzed by Goldman Sachs. That is in contrast to many institutional investors who have yanked money from the market. 

Yet much of the euphoria that dominated markets in 2020 has evaporated. A basket of popular stocks among individual investors that includes Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. has fallen 30% this year, underperforming the broader market. ***Technology stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rates, leading to especially steep losses.*** 

Meanwhile, intraday trading among individuals, as defined by daily dollar volume, has dropped to levels not seen since January 2020, before the pandemic, according to Vanda Research analysts. Individual traders’ activity in bullish call options, popular bets to profit from a surge in stocks, has tumbled to some of the lowest levels of the past two years, according to Deutsche Bank data.

***“The frenzied, frothy behavior isn’t there,” said Lule Demmissie, U.S. chief executive of the brokerage eToro. “But that long-term thesis of investing for the long term is.”***

Some of the momentum-driven trades that flourished over the past two years have caused big losses for investors. Attempting to buy the dip in Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF, for example, has been particularly painful. 

On Wednesday, shares of the fund jumped as much as 3.2% as traders piled in, hoping to ride a rebound after a continued selloff that has now dragged it down 60% this year. Instead, the fund ended the day down by roughly the same amount after the Fed’s interest-rate decision led many traders to rapidly change their forecasts for how aggressive the central bank would be in raising rates through next year. The rate increase stoked a sharp selloff across the market. 

The ARK ETF drew $197 million of inflows Wednesday, the most for a single day since July, according to FactSet. The fund resumed its slide Thursday, falling 4.3% and heading toward a double-digit decline for the week. 

Caleb Adams, an 18-year-old university student who said he started investing a few years ago through a custodial account, a type of investment account for minors, said the ARK fund has been one of his biggest losers. 

“I fell into the trap of the high-growth, highflying companies and invested money into her ETFs, and they have not done very well,” he said. 

Still, Mr. Adams, who started investing by buying into Tesla shares, said he has tried to continue stashing away money in his brokerage account regularly. Cash he received for his high-school graduation helped him increase his exposure to the market, as did money he earned doing odd jobs for his parents, such as organizing business contacts electronically for his mom. 

Mr. Tafarella said his approach has changed dramatically since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he tried his hand at day trading with little success. He was hoping to make enough money to help pay for his daughters’ college education and shield his family from the burden of student loans. 

“I started off feeling very greedy,” Mr. Tafarella said. “I thought, I can probably turn this into $100K within a year.”

Since then, he has shifted to a basket of diversified ETFs into which he has steadily poured money. 

One factor that is shifting the calculus for some investors: Ultrasafe government debt is suddenly looking attractive. High inflation and the Fed’s rate increases have stoked a sharp selloff in the bond market, sending yields to the highest levels of the past decade.

Claire de Weerdt, a 34-year-old consultant and business owner based near Vancouver, British Columbia, said she bought a fund overseeing stocks and bonds earlier in the year to diversify her holdings, though the fund has fallen in value along with the broader market. She has also parked some cash in a fixed-income investment for her business and has sought to build a bigger cash buffer in case of a recession. Still, she said she has no plans to sell her stocks.  

“I think it’d be silly to sell stocks,” Ms. de Weerdt said. ***“I don’t care what the markets are like in one or two years. I care what they’re like in 30 years.”***

I want to contrast this article with one posted earlier this year:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ummmp3/buy_the_dip_believers_are_tested_by_markets/

>>Individuals’ willingness to backstop markets throughout this year’s selloff demonstrates that the group—for now—has been more resilient than analysts and trading professionals anticipated. Few were surprised when individual investors pounced on small dips as the market churned higher last year, helping the S&P 500 cruise to 70 records and rewarding those who waded in.

This current article points to likely further capitulation by the retail investor.

Also, the CAPE is currently still at 27.  CAPE is simply the way Ben Graham uses PE ratios in the value school of investing, CAPE being an aggregate measure.  The inverse of CAPE gives you aggregate rate of return of the stock market...at 25, aggregate rate of return is 4%.  Long term average rate of return of the stock market is around 7-10%, i.e. 4% ROR is unsustainable unless you believe the stock market should return (far) less than 7%.  What this means is that in order to attain a healthy valuation of the stock market, its rate of return will need to increase, i.e. CAPE will have to decrease.  At CAPE 15, you get the 7% rate of return.  During the 70s, the last time we had persistent inflation, CAPE fell below 10.

Who is the best CEO right now and which CEO should quit or be replaced ?,"And I don't mean the charismatic and messianic type when I say the best. I mean the one who have a substantial record of accomplishments and his vision is being proved right. For me that one now is Jensen Huang from Nvidia.
When I say the one who should go away, he can have the best record, but he no longer fits in the company or has underperformed substantially recently. I will be controversial and say that one is Warren Edward Buffet from Berkshire."
The Bubble has Already Burst!,"A lot of people here are wondering if the equity bubble is going to burst but you're failing to realize it already has in many aspects of the market. High flier mid-small caps are all down over 50% + from their highs in an extremely short period of time and the only equities left are large caps which will be the last to fall. The only reason we haven't seen this bubble burst in a similar fashion to 2000 is that the large caps which make up the majority of indexes are barely holding up even though they are over valued. 

Here are some example of stocks this sub loved before and they've now gotten obliterated. 

PLTR - 70% from it's highs

PYPL - 66% from it's highs

NFLX - 43% from it's highs

SQ - 65% from it's highs

NVDA - 28%, MUCH more to come

And there is a lot more. 

The bubble has already burst in most places just some of the large caps are left. 

Good luck everyone."

> The decline in Magnificent Seven stocks has erased a collective $934 billion from their market capitalizations so far this week, which would make for the group’s worst-ever weekly loss of market value if it holds through the close.

> While Tesla Inc.’s stock TSLA, -1.92% is the biggest weekly percentage decliner of the gang from a stock perspective, Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.22%, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -1.27%  and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -10.00% are bigger contributors to the market-cap losses as they are all worth substantially more than the car maker.

> Nvidia is tracking toward being the biggest market-cap loser of the week, shedding $258 billion with about one hour left in Friday’s trading day. That’s more than the total market capitalization of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, -5.44%, at $236 billion.

> Shares of Nvidia are down 10.3% so far this week as the semiconductor sector has been under pressure. Nvidia’s stock is suffering its worst weekly performance since Sept. 2, 2022 on a percentage basis. It’s also down 8.1% in Friday action, putting it on track for its worst single-day percentage drop since it fell 9.5% on Sept. 13, 2022. With the stock down more than $68, it’s heading for its largest one-day price decline on record."
Analysts seem to just make up price targets as stocks shoot higher,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-nvda-stock-price-target-boosts-earnings-51636640350?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-nvda-stock-price-target-boosts-earnings-51636640350?siteid=yhoof2)

 ""Nvidia Stock Gets a 49% Price Target Boost Before Earnings. Why Analysts Are Bullish.  
 Analysts led by Rick Schafer at Oppenheimer reiterated their Outperform rating on Nvidia stock and raised their target price on the shares by 49% to $350 from $235.""

 ""Meanwhile, Christopher Rolland at Susquehanna reiterated his Positive rating on Nvidia stock and hiked his target price to $360 from $250. ""

Is it just me or do these guys just raise their price targets as the stock soars so their performance on websites like tipranks doesn't suffer? Nothing about nvidia's performance has changed this quarter that would suddenly warrant an increase of nvidia's market cap by 300 billion dollars. I think price targets are an important tool, especially for retail investors, but lately these guys seem to just make it up as they go. At $350 nvidia is a 900b company on 10b of forward net earnings. That's just bonkers and these guys seem to base their price targets on how far they think the current bull market can inflate the ever increasing sentiment instead of what the stock is fundamentally worth."
Congressional Insider Trading in 2022: Using Inside Knowledge to Make Profits,"Throughout 2022, there were a number of instances of very well timed trades among members of Congress. Let's examine a few examples.

In February, Marjorie Taylor Greene, a House Republican, bought stocks in Lockheed Martin, Chevron, and NextEra Energy. Mere days later, the Ukraine conflict escalated. Other politicians followed suit, buying up oil and defense stocks before the Ukraine invasion.

In July, Nancy and Paul Pelosi sold all their Nvidia stock. By August, Nvidia was instructed by the US to limit chip sales in China and Russia, causing the stock to drop 20%. When questioned about the timing of her sale, Pelosi remained silent.

Senator Thomas Carper bought bearish ETFs before significant rate hikes and CPI data from the federal reserve. Interestingly, he sits on the Senate Finance Committee, and his positions have profited.

Congress members also heavily invested in semiconductors prior to the passing of the CHIPS bill and restrictions in China. This led to significant gains for them in 2023.

Dan Crenshaw was questioned about his stock trades, including a sale in February that brought him a 32% return. In response, he implied that trading was a way for Congress members to better themselves.

In 2022, both Pat Fallon and Tom Suozzi faced STOCK Act violations for late disclosures of trades worth hundreds of thousands, but the House Ethics Committee dismissed their cases, citing lack of clear evidence of intentional non-disclosure. Both Fallon and Suozzi continued to make late disclosures of trades throughout the year.

Nvidia Vs AMD Vs Intel,"Between the 3 semiconductor stocks which one is your favorite and which one do you think can grow the most and have the best returns in the next 10 years or above?

i presonally think all 3 comapnies are great and can have very impressive returns in the long run."
"One year ago, I wrote a bear case for AMD. Let's review.","**About me:** I like to write about semiconductor companies and tech stocks. My previous analysis (examples: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/stzcql/google_announces_privacy_changes_to_android_that/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ss5w5r/big_cloud_winner_will_be_based_on_who_can_make/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sndmzr/softbanks_arm_to_ipo_buyers_beware/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sjkieh/why_fb_is_investing_so_heavily_into_vr_if_it_isnt/)) have been upvoted to the top of /r/stocks or near the top. I noticed that Wallstreet tends to be very late on seeing future trends of chipmakers, which allowed me to make a decent profit. For example, it was only last week when Barclays downgraded AMD on competitive trends. I first warned about this exact same thing, in more detail around a year ago.

I also recommended Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, TSMC, Amazon over AMD. This recommendation has done well as they've collectively been much better than AMD. I believe these companies will continue to beat AMD over the long run. By long run, I mean next 3 years.

Note that I rode AMD from $12 to around $80. Then I switched out to the above companies based on the thesis below. It has done extremely well for me.

**Original post:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is\_amd\_the\_king\_of\_the\_titanic\_x86/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/kg4e8j/is_amd_the_king_of_the_titanic_x86/)

The basic premise was that the computing industry as a whole is moving away from a duopoly (often monopoly) of Intel and AMD. x86 chips (which is what AMD and Intel make) are being replaced at a rapid rate on servers, and Apple Silicon jump-started the switch at the laptop and desktop level.

AMD was fortunate enough to catch Intel's pants down and it was fortunate enough to be making GPUs during the crypto boom.

But when the dust settles, AMD's future looks bleak.

Let's review some of my predictions below with comments in **bold**.

\---------

Most people here focus on AMD vs Intel or AMD vs Nvidia like it's still 2010.

In 2021, it's AMD vs Intel, Nvidia, ARM, Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Ampere, Nuvia.

It's tough to see an exponential trend when you're at the beginning. This post spells out the trends for all AMD markets.

**ARM Attack on consumer x86 market:**

* x86 market shrank by 10% the moment Apple announced a full transition to ARM **True. Apple Silicon is both faster, and far more efficient than AMD's very best chips today. Apple's Macs are growing extremely fast as a result.**
* Even worse, Apple is the forcing function for PC software makers to [support ARM](https://www.docker.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-chips-and-docker/), paving the way for Windows ARM **True. A ton of software makers have developed ARM versions in the last 2 years.**
* Microsoft has just announced [x86 emulation on their Windows ARM OS](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/) **Windows 11 ARM can now emulate x86 apps. Paving the way for ARM CPU makers on Windows.**
* Apple's entry-level [M1](https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-13-inch-late-2020) is faster than [4900HS](https://browser.geekbench.com/processors/amd-ryzen-9-4900hs) by 55% in single-core and 3.7% in multi-core while using 5x less power. You can buy an M1 laptop today while the 4900HS is a highly binned-part.
* Apple's entry-level iGPU blows away the very best AMD iGPU
* Apple's ARM chip allows the entry-level Macbook Pro to have 20 hours of battery life while staying extremely cool
* Apple is readying [8,16, 32 core SoCs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/apple-preps-next-mac-chips-with-aim-to-outclass-highest-end-pcs). For reference, M1 has only 4-high performance cores.
* Apple is poised to [significantly increase PC market-share](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/02/kuo-two-macbook-pros-2021-and-macbook-air-2022/), 100% within 3 years. **On pace.**
* In order to compete, PC makers like Dell, Lenovo, and HP will increasingly look to ARM alternatives
* Microsoft is working on in-house ARM chips for Surface **Yes. They hired Apple ARM architect. They're planning ARM chips for Azure as well.**
* Qualcomm is expected to become [a serious player](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020) in the laptop space **Yes. They bought Nuvia for $1.4 billion to focus on laptops (as the first market).**

**ARM Attack on hyperscalers market:**

* AWS's Graviton2 workload increased by 10x last year. In just one year, Graviton2 is now [10% of all AWS CPU](https://twitter.com/LucidCap/status/1338208878278926338) workloads. **In 2020, Graviton2 accounted for 50% of all new EC2 instances. It's likely much more in 2022. Amazon just announced Graviton3.**
* Like Apple in consumer market, Amazon is the forcing function for better ARM server software support **Yes. Almost all popular server software now have ARM versions.**
* Amazon will most certainly prioritize in-house designs over x86 chips. In the future, Amazon will likely offer x86 only for legacy software. **Looking like it. Look up Graviton3. Amazon is all in.**
* AWS controls 40% of the cloud. If AWS moves most of its future workload to its own CPUs, then AMD can control at best 60% of what Intel used to contol.
* In house ARM chips allow hyperscalers to differentiate, save on cost, and build chips tailored to their unique challenges
* Microsoft is designing its own ARM cloud chips **Yes**
* You can expect Google, Baidu, Tencent to follow soon **Yes. Alibaba, Tencent both launched custom ARM chips for their clouds. Baidu will soon as well. Google has signaled that they will be developing custom ARM chips for their cloud.**
* Hyperscalers don't want to be controlled by a duopoly. If Intel isn't grabbing them by the balls, then it's just AMD. It's the same thing. Hyperscalers want to control their own destiny and ARM allows them to.

**ARM Attack on small size cloud companies:**

* Ampere will allow smaller cloud companies to buy into ARM **If Ampere was a public company, I'd be buying a lot.**
* Anandtech just said that Ampere's latest 80-core chip is [42% better than Epyc](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16315/the-ampere-altra-review/9) in terms of cost/performance
* Ampere is releasing a 128-core chip in 2021
* Anandtech says Ampere's 2022 N1 Neoverse chip could be 50% faster at minimum
* Very well-funded startup Nuvia is also competing here **Bought by Qualcomm to bring ARM to Windows laptops**

**GPUs:**

* Apple will no longer use AMD GPUs in their computers. Bloomberg reports that Apple is testing [64-core and 128-core GPUs](https://videocardz.com/newz/apple-reportedly-developing-high-end-32-core-cpus-and-128-core-gpus). For reference, M1 has 8 GPU cores.
* Nvidia's grip on server GPUs and AI is tight and AMD has a mountain to climb in order to catchup
* With ARM, Nvidia can now offer complete server units from CPU to GPU to interconnects, just like AMD **Although the ARM deal fell through, Nvidia introduced their Grace CPU which they claim is faster than and more efficient than anything AMD offers.**
* Intel is joining the cloud GPU competition, and they're expected to use TSMC to manufacture Xe GPUs. **True**

**Consoles:**

* Mobile gaming is now [3x bigger than consoles](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-reaches-137-9-billion-in-2018-mobile-games-take-half/)
* Consoles are a low-margin business
* It's quite possible that PS5/Xbox Series X are the last consoles ever if AAA gaming moves to the cloud in the next 6-7 years

**TSMC:**

* As more companies move to in-house designs, competition for TSMC wafers are expected to increase significantly
* Apple is likely to continue to hold a node advantage lead because they have a lot more cash and a lot more volume. Apple's volume will likely increase significantly with Apple Silicon Macs. Ming-Chi Kuo expects Apple to sell 35 million Macs/year by 2023.
* Unlike Intel, AMD does not have a node advantage over Qualcomm, Ampere, Nuvia, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
* Intel is expected to [make a decision](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4067508) on whether they will invest in their 7nm process node in Spring of 2021 or use TSMC. If Intel decides to go fabless instead, AMD will lose its node advantage over Intel and wafer prices will increase for everyone. **Semi-true.** **Intel will use TSMC 3nm AND continue to develop their 7nm node (renamed to Intel 4). This means Intel will be competing with AMD for TSMC wafers and will continue to build out their own fab.**

**If you're buying into AMD long-term, you have to believe that:**

* AMD will become a monopoly in the x86 market in record time **Not going to happen. Intel's Alder Lake has the performance crown now and better architecture. While Zen4 will be better, Intel is incredibly aggressive with its roadmap.**
* Intel will not switch to TSMC and does not fix its node issues. Basically, you expect Intel to do nothing. **Intel's Alder Lake is a huge return to the performance crown.**
* AMD can make enough progress in Zen to delay the inevitable full ARM dominance
* AMD is working on ARM chips now, or will buy Ampere/Nuvia to enter the ARM race **Nuvia already bought by Qualcomm**
* Wall Street will respond well if AMD decides to go ARM and bet against their own cash cow: Epyc
* AMD can eventually compete with Nvidia in GPUs/AI
* AMD takes a big piece of the cloud gaming pie
* Consoles will have another generation after PS5/Xbox
* Microsoft, Google, Baidu, Tencent, Qualcomm, Nuvia, Nvidia, Intel fail to compete with Zen and Radeon

**My personal recommendation:**

* You can own AMD
* You're crazy if you're still all-in on AMD
* You should diversify your portfolio with TSMC, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia **This suggestion proved to be wise. AMD is getting downgraded while Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia continue to soar. Amazon is doing well. TSMC is ok.**"
Are NVIDIA employees likely to be millionaires now if they joined five or more years ago?,"I’m trying to figure out the current value of NVIDIA stock options that were granted 5 years ago.

Assuming someone joined NVIDIA and was given stock options worth $36,000 at that time (pretty standard of a sales person)..

And considering all the stock splits that have occurred since then, including the most recent 10-for-1 split in 2024..

How much would those options be worth at today’s stock price?

"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 12th, 2020.

# **Earnings could be a positive force for stocks as Washington continues to wrangle over stimulus  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/earnings-could-be-a-positive-force-for-stocks-as-washington-continues-to-wrangle-over-stimulus.html)**
*****
> Stock market optimism for a stimulus package has been rising, but the focus swings to earnings and that could be a positive for stocks in the week ahead.
*****
> JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley all release earnings in the first big wave of corporate reports. There is also some important data, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales for September on Friday.
*****
> “It looks like earnings season might turn out better than expected, based on early reports,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The guidance looks pretty good. So, we have earnings season upon us, the stimulus talks go back and forth, and it looks like maybe there’s a will to get something done.”
*****
> On Friday afternoon, the White House raised its offer for at stimulus package to $1.8 trillion but was still below the $2.2 trillion sought by Democrats. “It’s really hard to read,” said Keon.
*****
> But he said even if there’s no agreement on stimulus now, there should be a package after the election, regardless of who wins. 
*****
> “I actually put some money to work in small caps on the belief if we get further stimulus either soon or a few months from now, you do want to own economically sensitive stocks,” said Keon.“We’re reasonably constructive on the market and valuations are not cheap, but compared to the 10-year [Treasury yield] at less than 80 basis points, stocks don’t look that bad.”
*****
> Stocks in the past week had their best performance since early July, with the S&P 500 up 3.8% at 3,477. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 6.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield had a big move during the week from about 0.70% to as high as 0.79% Friday. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year yield has now broken out of a range its been stuck in below 0.70%.
*****
> Earnings could provide positive momentum for stocks, if companies continue to beat estimates at a healthy pace, like last quarter.
*****
> “Q2 reporting season saw S&P 500 earnings beat at an unprecedented rate, both in terms of breadth (85%) and size (+20%), prompting historically rare, strong upgrades to forward estimates, especially for the cyclicals, and one of the strongest earnings season rallies on record,” wrote Deutsche Bank strategists.
*****
> The summer earnings rally came before the big September decline, which took the S&P 500  down about 10%. The S&P 500 is up more than 8% since Sept. 24.
*****
> “While the bottom-up consensus for Q3 is for a sharp rebound in headline earnings, the bulk of it is being driven by reductions in loan loss provisions and Energy sector losses. Excluding these, underlying earnings growth is forecast to barely move up (-15% to -13%), despite rising Q3 GDP growth estimates pointing to a strong macro rebound,” they noted.
*****
> The Deutsche strategists said the question remains, however, whether the market will respond to earnings beats or election uncertainty.
*****
> Keon said the market has been moving up as former vice president Joe Biden extended his lead in the polls because there’s less chance of an uncertain outlook the more one candidate leads. According to RealClearPolitics, he was leading President Donald Trump by 9.7 percentage points, from just about  6 points at the beginning of the prior week.
*****
> “I think from the market’s perspective, it doesn’t really matter who wins, as long as we have a clear winner,” said Keon. “I think the direction of the polls are suggesting that we’re going to have a clear winner either on election night or a few days after that. The risk of a messy contested election is going down, and the market is relieved by that.”
*****
> Tom Block, Washington analyst at Fundstrat, said Trump appears to be hoping for a stimulus bill signing before the election to help his re-election effort.
*****
> “There are many moving parts here, and they’re all moving in different directions,” said Block. “It’s not impossible a deal comes together but the pathway to a deal is not clear on Friday afternoon because of the mixed signals that have come out over the last seven days from the White House.”
*****
> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has opposed a large package, and the two sides have been stalemated. “I think the president believes that he will be helped by having a signed ceremony at the White House approving the bill, that the optics of signing the bill that’s going to send relief to people is an optic he desperately wants, and it can’t hurt,” he said.
*****
> The economic recovery is going on in the background, and some parts of the economy have shown real improvement, like housing.
*****
> Retail sales on Friday is a good look at how the consumer has been faring, now that enhanced unemployment benefits have been gone for the past two months. Economists expect 0.6% gain in retail sales, the same as August.
*****
> Keon said it is important to get some more help for the economy through stimulus. There is expected to be one-time payments to individuals and enhanced employment benefits.
*****
> “That would be good news for the market, if we could get more help where it is needed. We really just need to get a bridge for a more normal circumstances next year,” said Keon.

> # Ten-Baggers Under Trump

> In our prior post we looked at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks since Election Day 2016. In this post we've broadened our filter and looked at the Russell 3,000, which is an index that covers more than 98% of all publicly traded market cap in the US. Within the Russell 3,000, there are 32 stocks that are up more than 1,000% since Trump was elected. These 32 ""ten-baggers"" -- as Peter Lynch liked to call them -- are listed in the table below.

> At the top of the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH), which is up 8,892% since Election Day 2016. While Enphase has ""Energy"" in its company name, it's actually a Technology sector stock that ""manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control."" Next up is Zynex (ZYXI) with a gain of 7,211%, followed by Digital Turbine (APPS) up 5,320%. ZYXI markets itself as a ""better and safer way to manage pain"" than opiods using electrotherapy devices. APPS is an app marketing company that helps app developers get their product on as many devices as possible.

> Of the 16 best performing Russell 3,000 stocks since Election Day 2016, 15 come from either the Technology or Health Care sectors. XPEL is the only stock in the top ten that's not in either the Tech or Health Care sectors. Up 2,341% since Trump was elected, XPEL is a Consumer Discretionary stock whose main product is to provide auto-paint protection.

> Along with the names mentioned already, other notables on the list of ten-baggers under Trump include Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), pet-food maker Freshpet (FRPT), digital health company Teladoc (TDOC), the arts and crafts social media company Etsy (ETSY), and of course, Tesla (TSLA). With a gain of 1,002% since November 8th, 2016, Tesla just barely makes the cut!

> # Best Performing Stocks Since Election Day 2016

> On Monday we published our asset class performance matrix showing total returns for key ETFs since Election Day 2016 (11/8/16). Today we wanted to highlight the individual stocks traded on US exchanges that have performed the best and the worst since President Trump surprised the world with a victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. First off, below is a chart showing the average performance of stocks in each S&P 500 sector since Election Day 2016. (These are based on stocks currently in the index and not as the index stood on 11/8/16.)

> As shown, the average stock in the broad S&P 500 is up 67.3% since Trump was elected. Four sectors have posted stronger average returns than that -- Technology (+160.4%), Health Care (+100.3%), Consumer Discretionary (+74.6%), and Industrials (+69.9%).

> The Energy sector stands out like a sore thumb in the chart below. While every other sector has at least averaged double-digit percentage gains, the stocks in the Energy sector are down an average of 52.3% since Trump was elected! Other sectors that have been weaker than the broad market include Real Estate, Consumer Staples, and Financials.

> If you were to ask most people back in November 2016 which areas of the market should outperform under Trump and which should underperform, you'd likely see results that are the exact opposite of what has actually happened. Sectors like Energy, Real Estate, and Financials would have been expected to benefit from Trump since those are the industries he's most associated with, while Tech is a sector that's usually expected to benefit more when the Democratic party is in control.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/avgsector.png))**

> Looking at individual stocks, below we show the 46 stocks currently in the S&P 500 that are up at least 200% since Election Day 2016. Two stocks -- Etsy (ETSY) and Advanced Micro (AMD) -- have been ""10-baggers"" with gains of more than 1,000%, while another three -- Paycom (PAYC), NVIDIA (NVDA) and DexCom (DXCM) -- are up more than 500%. Other names on the list are a who's who of the most popular stocks over the past few years, including Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), salesforce.com (CRM), and PayPal (PYPL).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/bestsince16.png))**

> While there are 46 stocks in the S&P 500 up more than 200% since Election Day 2016, there are 32 stocks that are down more than 50% over the same time frame. The Energy sector is the most represented on this list by far with 14 stocks overall and 10 of the worst 11! The only non-Energy stock in the top ten is General Electric (GE), which is down 76% since Trump was elected. Other notable losers include airlines and cruiselines like AAL, CCL, and NCLH, and consumer stocks like TAP, KHC, UAA, WBA, and LB.

> General Electric (GE) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are the two names that stand out the most. Each of these stocks were at one point in time the largest company in the world, but they're both now shells of their former selves with huge losses over the last four years. Remember these two examples when you're looking at the largest companies in the world right now. Chances are a few of them will experience similar fates as GE and XOM over the next ten to twenty years.

> # News High for Net New Highs

> Yesterday, the S&P 500 closed at its highest level since only a few days after the early September high. While the index has yet to reach a new high, many individual stocks in the index have. As shown in the charts below, 11.71% of S&P 500 stocks closed at a new 52-week high yesterday while no stocks closed at a new 52-week low. That makes for the second-highest net new highs reading of the pandemic with the only higher reading (17.62%) occurring just over a month ago at the last all-time high on September 2nd. Before that, the last time net new highs were as high as now was on February 19th: the last all-time high before the bear market began.

> As for the individual sectors, there has also been a significant pickup in the net percentage of new 52-week highs. Industrials currently has the highest reading of net new highs among the 11 sectors at 26%. Just like the broader S&P 500, that is the highest since September 2nd when the net percentage of new highs rose above 30%. Consumer Discretionary is the runner up in being the sector with the highest percentage of net new highs. One distinguishing factor, though, is whereas every other sector has seen higher readings at some point since the bear market in the spring, Consumer Discretionary's current reading of 18% is tied with the reading from August 24th. On the other end of the spectrum, both Communication Services and the Energy sector have seen no new highs over the past few days. Granted, there have not been any new 52-week lows either. Meanwhile, Financials and Real Estate have both seen an uptick in net new highs, but it has been much more modest than other sectors.

> # Breadth Booming

> One of the most notable aspects of the rally off the late September lows has been broad participation. As shown below, breadth is very strong as the 10-day advance-decline lines for several sectors are at some of their highest levels of the past year. For the S&P 500, the 10-day advance-decline line is at its highest level since June 8th. The same can be said for Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Financials, and Real Estate. For Consumer Staples, the sector's 10-day A/D line is at its highest level since June of 2019 and for Health Care it is at its highest level since May of 2019. In the case of Technology, it has been even longer as that sector's line is at its highest level since last April.

> While broad participation is healthy for the long-term prospects of a rally, these 10-Day A/D lines have gotten extremely overbought in the near term, suggesting a cool-down period is likely in the days ahead.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/100820-10-day.png))**

> With short term breadth running very hot, the cumulative A/D lines of several sectors are breaking out to new highs as well. Utilities and Materials are the only sectors to have seen prices reach a new high in the past few days alongside their cumulative A/D lines. As for the other sectors, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Materials, and Tech have also all seen new highs for cumulative breadth. The same applies to the S&P 500, but again, none of these have yet to see price do the same.

> # Election-Year October Market Performance Volatile since 1950

> October’s history of volatility was recapped in the October Almanac as well as it being the worst performing month of election years since 1950. In the following chart we have plotted election-year October performance for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1950 (NASDAQ since 1972 and Russell indexes since 1980) alongside their historical performance excluding gruesome election-year October 2008.

> With or without October 2008, historical performance has been uninspiring in election years. Excluding 2008, October has generally started off on a positive note, but by around the fourth trading day, strength has tended to fade with weakness persisting until around the eighth trading day. Then a modest rally ensued through mid-month followed by more weakness and finally a rally to end the month. Grey shading highlights the two historical windows of weakness that could setup our Seasonal MACD indicators.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks."
"Apple says it uses no Nvidia GPUs to train its AI models, instead using Google's TPUs","Surprised to learn that Apple is using Google chips instead of Nvidia.

I guess this is partially why Google is now the third largest datacenter chip designer and will be #2 before the end of the year.

https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-says-it-uses-no-nvidia-gpus-train-its-ai-models-2024-07-29/?utm_source=reddit.com&utm_source=reddit

https://blog.svc.techinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DCC-2405-806_Figure2.png"
"During the crypto crash in 2018, Nvidia had 4 straight quarters of negative YoY revenue growth","* \-24% in Q1 2019
* \-30% in Q2 2019
* \-17% in Q3 2019
* \-5% in Q4 2019

Nvidia's stock price dropped by about 53% during this period. It didn't recover until the pandemic-fueled boom.

This is because when crypto crashes, miners will flood the market with used GPUs, giving bargain prices to gamers. MSRP prices for gaming GPUs doubled during the boom. What happens when GPU prices drop to half of MSRP?

In the last 3 months, ETH mining profitability has dropped by 50%. 70% in the last 6 months. This doesn't even account for electricity cost inflation.

ETH itself is down 30% in the last 7 days.

Nvidia does not break out its gaming and crypto sales. They lump both categories into their gaming sales category. Therefore, no one can reliably model the impact. But if I have to guess, it won't be as bad as 2018 if crypto does not go back up because Nvidia's overall revenue has diversified a bit since 2018.

However, 2018 is very different than 2022 for Nvidia. In 2018, Nvidia only faced the crypto crash. In 2022, Nvidia faces a triple whammy: **recession-risk** (GPUs are a non-essential good and expensive), **people going outside more** (less gaming), and **crypto crash** (mining). While some companies are facing one or two of these issues, very few are impacted by all three.

Like most tech companies during the pandemic-boom, Nvidia also hired a ton of workers and started projects that don't either don't make any money or loses money. Nvidia's employee count went from \~13,000 to \~22,000 from 2020 to 2022.

The question is, is Wallstreet ready for negative Nvidia revenue growth? Do you think Wallstreet has already priced this in? Right now, Nvidia's PE is still at a premium over the market. What happens when its growth is negative for 4 quarters?

Long term, I still believe in Nvidia. But watch out in the next 1-2 years.

NVDA beats earnings estimates,"Revenue of $6.51B beats a $6.33B consensus. 

Non-GAAP EPS of $1.04 beats a $1.02 consensus.

FQ3 guiding revenue of $6.8B, plus or minus 2%. above a $6.57B consensus.

Data Center segment revenue rose 16% Q/Q and 35% Y/Y to $2.37B, topping a $2.27B consensus.

Gaming segment revenue rose 11% Q/Q and 85% Y/Y in FQ2 to $3.06B, topping a $2.98B consensus.

Automotive revenue came in at $152M -- down 1% Q/Q, up 37% Y/Y and below a $164M consensus.

The Professional Visualization segment, which covers workstation GPUs and other offerings for visual creators, saw revenue grow 40% Q/Q and 156% Y/Y to $519M. That soundly beat a $364M consensus.

Nvidia adds that sales of its CMP GPUs, which target crypto miners, accounted for $266M of this total. This compares with FQ1 CMP revenue of $155M.

The ""OEM and Other"" segment, which among things covers non-gaming PC GPUs, posted revenue of $409M. That's up 25% Q/Q and 180% Y/Y, but below a $463M consensus.

Nvidia says it didn’t receive antitrust subpoena from DOJ,"

Nvidia on Wednesday denied reports it received a subpoena from the Department of Justice over antitrust concerns.

“We have inquired with the U.S. Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed,” an Nvidia representative told CNBC. “Nonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that Nvidia had received a subpoena, causing the stock to [slip in after-hours trading](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/03/nvidia-slides-in-post-market-trading-after-drop-wiped-out-300-billion.html). The chipmaker’s shares had already given up nearly 10% during regular trading Tuesday.

While the report did not specify a reason for regulators to be interested in Nvidia, the company’s recent rise has been directly tied to its dominance in artificial intelligence chips for data centers years before competitors AMD and Intel started taking the category seriously.

Nvidia has more than 80% of the data center AI chip market, according to industry estimates.

Nvidia “wins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,” Nvidia told CNBC.

Nvdia to stop all product sales to Russia,"Nvidia on Friday said it’s halting all product sales to Russia following the country’s invasion of Ukraine. “We are not selling into Russia,” an Nvidia spokesperson told PCMag. 

The company didn’t elaborate on why. But the spokesperson said the sales suspension covers all Nvidia products. 

Other major US tech companies have also halted sales to Russia, citing the war in Ukraine. On Friday, Microsoft called the invasion “unlawful,” and announced it would suspend “all new sales” of company products to the country, which should include the Windows OS, Microsoft cloud services and the Xbox console. 

The day before, both AMD and Intel also said they were halting all chip sales to Russia and Belarus, the country’s ally in the invasion of Ukraine. ""We will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine and the global community in calling for an immediate end to this war and a swift return to peace,” Intel wrote in its own announcement.

WSJ - S&P 500 ends longest bear market since the 1940s and signals beginning of new bull market.,"U.S. stocks rose Thursday, ending the S&P 500’s longest bear market since the 1940s and marking the start of a new bull run. 

The broad index powered higher over the past few months, in large part because of a handful of companies posting outsize gains.

Many of those same stocks, including Amazon.com, Tesla and chip maker Nvidia, led the market’s advance Thursday. 

That helped propel the S&P 500 up 0.6%, allowing the index to finish up 20% from its October low.

The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 33833.

Treasury yields retreated. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.714%, down from 3.782% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.

Analysts attributed the relative calm to traders taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key events next week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release fresh data on inflation Tuesday, while the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision Wednesday.

So far, positioning in futures markets suggests many traders are betting the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in June. That might offer markets some relief in the short-term, although investors warn that there could still be more policy-tightening ahead. 

“A pause does not mean they are done with rate hikes,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors. 

Traders are betting volatility could pick up in the coming months. The options contracts with the biggest positions tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, or Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” are wagers that it will surge to 30—a level associated with investor anxiety—or 60, a level only seen during stock-market crashes.

Among individual stocks, electric-car maker Tesla jumped 4.6% to $234.86, posting its 10th straight session of gains. That marked the company’s longest winning streak since an 11-session run that ended in January 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. 

Carvana, the online used car retailer, rose 56% to $24.23 after saying it expects its profit to jump in the second quarter.

GameStop plunged 18% to $21.44 after the videogame retailer fired its CEO, Matt Furlong, and appointed board member Ryan Cohen as its new executive chairman. 

U.S. crude oil prices initially dropped after a report suggested U.S.-Iran talks on a temporary nuclear deal could allow the Islamic Republic to export more crude. They pared some of their losses by the end of the trading day, though, finishing down 1.7% at $71.29 a barrel.

Global stock markets were mixed. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.3% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 retreated 0.9%. The Stoxx Europe 600 finished about flat.

Mark Zuckerberg Says Meta Will Own Billions Worth of Nvidia H100 GPUs by Year End,"https://www.barrons.com/articles/zuckerberg-meta-nvidia-gpu-b0632fed

On Instagram Thursday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will have 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units and overall almost 600,000 H100 compute equivalent GPUs by the end of this year.

“Our long term vision is to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit,” he wrote in the post. “We’re building massive compute infrastructure to support our future roadmap” for artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg also said he excited about Meta’s progress incorporating AI technology in other type of devices like its Ray Ban smart glasses.

Start-ups and enterprise have clamored for Nvidia ’s GPUs, or graphics processing units because they are well suited for the parallel computations needed for AI projects.

A Meta spokesperson declined to provide clarity on the timing of H100 purchases and on whether the other H100 equivalent GPUs consisted of other Nvidia GPU models or were from different third parties.

Nvidia declined to comment on the timing of Meta’s H100 purchases.

The H100 is Nvidia’s current top-of-line data center GPU and costs roughly $25,000 per GPU, according to a slide in an earlier company presentation that showed a 16 H100 GPU system costs $400,000.

Though, it is unknown at what price Meta can purchase the H100, a quantity of 350,000 at $25,000 per GPU comes to nearly $9 billion.

"Amazon spends $2.75B on AI startup Anthropic, its largest venture investment","Amazon is making its largest outside investment in its three-decade history as it looks to gain an edge in the artificial intelligence race. 

The tech giant said it will spend another $2.75 billion backing Anthropic, a San Francisco-based startup that’s widely viewed as a frontrunner in generative artificial intelligence. Its foundation model and chatbot Claude competes with OpenAI and ChatGPT.

The companies announced an initial $1.25 billion investment in September, and said at the time that Amazon would invest up to $4 billion. Wednesday’s news marks Amazon’s second tranche of that funding.

Amazon will maintain a minority stake in the company and won’t have an Anthropic board seat, the company said. The deal was struck at the AI startup’s last valuation, which was $18.4 billion, according to a source. 

Over the past year, Anthropic closed five different funding deals worth about $7.3 billion — and with the new Amazon investment, the total exceeds $10 billion. The company’s product directly competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT in both the enterprise and consumer worlds, and it was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives and employees.

News of the Amazon investment comes weeks after Anthropic debuted Claude 3, its newest suite of AI models that it says are its fastest and most powerful yet. The company said the most capable of its new models outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini Ultra on industry benchmark tests, such as undergraduate level knowledge, graduate level reasoning and basic mathematics.

“Generative AI is poised to be the most transformational technology of our time, and we believe our strategic collaboration with Anthropic will further improve our customers’ experiences, and look forward to what’s next,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and AI at AWS.

Amazon’s move is the latest in a spending blitz among cloud providers to stay ahead in the AI race. And it’s the second update in a week to Anthropic’s capital structure. Late Friday, bankruptcy filings showed crypto exchange FTX struck a deal with a group of buyers to sell the majority of its stake in Anthropic, confirming a CNBC report from last week.

The term generative AI entered the mainstream and business vernacular seemingly overnight, and the field has exploded over the past year, with a record $29.1 billion invested across nearly 700 deals in 2023, according to PitchBook. OpenAI’s ChatGPT first showcased the tech’s ability to produce human-like language and creative content in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has said more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted the platform, spanning industries such as financial services, legal applications and education.

Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services don’t want to be caught flat-footed.

It’s a symbiotic relationship. As part of the agreement, Anthropic said it will use AWS as its primary cloud provider. It will also use Amazon chips to train, build and deploy its foundation models. Amazon has been designing its own chips that may eventually compete with Nvidia. 

Microsoft has been on its own spending spree with a high-profile investment into OpenAI. Microsoft’s OpenAI bet has reportedly jumped to $13 billion as the startup’s valuation has topped $29 billion. Microsoft’s Azure is also OpenAI’s exclusive provider for computing power, which means the startup’s success and new business flows back to Microsoft’s cloud servers.

Google, meanwhile, has also backed Anthropic, with its own deal for Google Cloud. It agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, comprising a $500 million cash infusion, with another $1.5 billion to be invested over time. Salesforce is also a backer.

Anthropic’s new model suite, announced earlier this month, marks the first time the company has offered “multimodality,” or adding options like photo and video capabilities to generative AI.

But multimodality, and increasingly complex AI models, also lead to more potential risks. Google recently took its AI image generator, part of its Gemini chatbot, offline after users discovered historical inaccuracies and questionable responses, which circulated widely on social media.

Anthropic’s Claude 3 does not generate images; instead, it only allows users to upload images and other documents for analysis.

“Of course no model is perfect, and I think that’s a very important thing to say upfront,” Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei told CNBC earlier this month. “We’ve tried very diligently to make these models the intersection of as capable and as safe as possible. Of course there are going to be places where the model still makes something up from time to time.”

Amazon’s biggest venture bet before Anthropic was electric vehicle maker Rivian, where it invested more than $1.3 billion. That too, was a strategic partnership. 

These partnerships have been picking up in the face of more antitrust scrutiny. A drop in acquisitions by the Magnificent Seven — Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla — has been offset by an increase in venture-style investing, according to Pitchbook.

AI and machine-learning investments from those seven tech companies jumped to $24.6 billion last year, up from $4.4 billion in 2022, according to Pitchbook. At the same time, Big Tech’s M&A deals fell from 40 deals in 2022 to 13 last year. 

“There is a sort of paranoia motivation to invest in potential disruptors,” Pitchbook AI analyst, Brendan Burke, said in an interview. “The other motivation is to increase sales, and to invest in companies that are likely to use the other company’s product — they tend to be partners, more so than competitors.”

Big Tech’s spending spree in AI has come under fire for the seemingly circular nature of these agreements. By investing in AI startups, some, including Benchmark’s Bill Gurley have accused the tech giants of funneling cash back to their cloud businesses, which in turn, may show up as revenue. Gurley described it as a way to “goose your own revenues.”

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is taking a closer look at these partnerships, including Microsoft’s OpenAI deal and Google and Amazon’s Anthropic investments. What’s sometimes called “round tripping” can be illegal — especially if the aim is to mislead investors. But Amazon has said that this type of venture investing does not constitute round tripping.

FTC Chair Lina Khan announced the inquiry during the agency’s tech summit on AI, describing it as a “market inquiry into the investments and partnerships being formed between AI developers and major cloud service providers.”

"Bloomberg: Intel to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs, Fund Rebound","Intel Corp. plans to eliminate thousands of jobs to reduce costs and fund an ambitious effort to rebound from an earnings slump and market share losses.

The workforce reduction may be announced as early as this week, according to people familiar with the company’s plans, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Intel, which is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings Thursday, has about 110,000 employees, excluding workers at units that are being spun out.

Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger is spending heavily on research and development aimed at improving Intel’s technology and helping it return to prominence in the semiconductor industry. The company’s once-dominant position eroded under Gelsinger’s predecessors as rivals, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc., have caught up and taken market share. An Intel spokesperson declined to comment.

Intel shares rose about 1% in late trading, reaching as high as $31.11, on the news.

Other chipmakers led by Nvidia Corp. have sprinted ahead in the development of lucrative semiconductors tailored for demanding artificial intelligence-related tasks. Intel is also coming to grips with uneven demand for chips that run laptops and desktop computers, its main business.

Gelsinger, betting that Intel can improve its technology, embarked on a plan to build factories to manufacture semiconductors for other chipmakers. Last week, Intel hired Naga Chandrasekaran from Micron Technology Inc. as chief global operations officer, putting him in charge of the company’s overall manufacturing efforts.

Intel reduced its workforce about 5% in 2023 to 124,800 by year’s end after announcing job cuts beginning in October 2022. It also has slowed spending in other areas. The company expected those cost reductions would save as much as $10 billion by 2025.

Analysts project that Intel will report that second-quarter revenue was flat, compared with a year earlier. Growth will pick up modestly in the second half of 2024, and total sales will increase 3% to $55.7 billion for the full year, according to Wall Street estimates. That would be the first annual revenue increase since 2021.

Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway hits $1 trillion market value ,"Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reached a $1 trillion market capitalization on Wednesday, the first non-technology company in the U.S. to score the coveted milestone.

Shares of the Omaha-based conglomerate have rallied more than 27% in 2024, nearly doubling the S&P 500′s return. The $1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ turns 94 years old.

The shares were up 1.2% on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet.

Unlike the six other companies in the trillion dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen. (Although its sizable Apple position has helped drive recent gains.)

Buffett took control of Berkshire, a struggling textile business, in the 1960s and transformed the company into a sprawling empire that encompasses insurance, railroad, retail and energy with an unmatched balance sheet and cash fortress.

Buffett has been in a defensive mode as of late, dumping a massive amount of stock, including half of his Apple stake, while raising Berkshire’s cash pile to a record $277 billion at the end of June.

While Buffett famously never times the market and advises others to not try to either, these recent moves served as a wake-up call to some of his followers on Wall Street, who believe he saw some things he did not like about the economy and market valuation.

Berkshire invests the majority of its cash in short-term Treasury bills, and its holding in such securities — valued at $234.6 billion at the end of the second quarter — has exceeded the amount the U.S. Federal Reserve owns.

High price tag

Berkshire’s original Class A shares carry one of the highest price tags on Wall Street. Today, each one sells for 68% more than the median price of a home in the U.S. 

That’s because Buffett has never split the stock, arguing that the high share price attracts and retains more long-term, quality-oriented investors. The Ben Graham protégé has said that many Berkshire shareholders use their stock as a savings account.

Still, Berkshire issued Class B shares in 1996 at a price equal to one thirtieth of a Class A share to cater to smaller investors wanting a small piece of the Buffett’s performance.

"Arm shares spike 24% after chip designer gives strong forecast, says AI is increasing sales","Arm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat estimates and gave a strong profit forecast for the current quarter. The shares soared more than 20% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending December:

Revenue: $824 million, vs. $761 million expected

EPS: 29 cents adjusted, vs 25 cents expected.


Arm, whose chip design technology is in nearly every smartphone and many PCs, said it expects earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of between 28 cents and 32 cents on sales of $850 million to $900 million. Analysts expectations earnings of 21 cents per share on sales of $780 million.

The company reported net income of $87 million, or 8 cents per share. Total revenue in the quarter increased 14% from a year earlier.

Arm makes money through royalties, when companies pay for access to build Arm-compatible chips, usually amounting to a small percentage of the final chip price.

Arm said its customers shipped 7.7 billion Arm chips during the September quarter, which is the most recent period which figures are available.

Royalty revenue increased 11% on an annual basis to $470 million. The company said the jump was partially because of a recovery in the smartphone market, as well as increasing sales to automotive companies and cloud providers. Arm said that it expects growth to be driven by royalty revenue.

In recent years, Arm has emphasized its licensing business, selling access to more complete designs that semiconductor companies can take and plug into their planned chips. That process saves chipmakers time and effort, and it’s more lucrative for Arm than simply collecting royalties.

Arm’s license and other revenue was $354 million, up 18% year-over-year. Arm said more companies were choosing to license its CPU designs to run artificial intelligence, and that the company charges higher licensing fees for advanced designs.

Arm, which had been owned by SoftBank, went public in September. The company was founded in 1990 to develop technology for low-power chips, but became more important to the overall technology industry when the Apple
 iPhone and competing Android devices standardized on Arm-based chips.

Arm says that companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia use its technology.

Amazon Hits $2 Trillion Valuation For First Time Ever,"Amazon.com Inc. has reached a $2 trillion market valuation for the first time ever as an artificial intelligence-fueled rally pushed the tech giant deeper into record territory. 

Shares rose as much as 3.6% Wednesday to $193.04, pushing the market value to more than $2 trillion. The company is now a member of an elite club of a handful of peers that have surpassed the key market capitalization. Alphabet Inc. passed the $2 trillion threshold in late April, while rallies have pushed market values of Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. to more than $3 trillion. 

Amazon shares have whipsawed since the company’s first quarter earnings, when the cloud unit posted the strongest sales growth in a year, helping to power the stock back above the all-time high set in April. The stock rallied in June, recovering losses from the end of May to gain about 27% so far this year.

Shares of the megacap technology company have gotten a lift over the past year as the company cut costs and restructured its business to better take advantage of the AI frenzy. In addition, its key Amazon Web Services business has shown signs of re-accelerating growth, a major point of optimism for investors. "
So what happens after I've waited 2+ decades?,"Currently 18, I was always interested in stocks and the number one thing I've heard across all these subreddits/youtube/tik tok/ boards is to ""Buy VOO/blue chips and then wait. Just wait decades and you'll see the results"". 

And I wholeheartedly believe and understand that. I have like $900 in VOO alone and like $500 split among some big tech companies (NVDA/AAPL/GOOG/MSFT). It's not much but I figure I would start now. 

But what happens after I've waited, and kept putting money into my portfolio? Like when I'm 40 and I see what my patience has given me, what do I do then? Do I sell it all? Some of it?

 When do I actually get to use this accumulated money? And what should I use it for?"
Elon Musk ordered Nvidia to ship AI chips reserved for Tesla to X and xAI ,"Elon Musk claims he can grow Tesla into “a leader in AI & robotics,” an ambition that he’s said will require a lot of pricey processors from Nvidia to build up its infrastructure.

On Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk said the electric vehicle company will increase the number of active H100s — Nvidia’s flagship artificial intelligence chip — from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year “in combined training and inference AI.”

But emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla’s procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.

By ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker’s receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.

“Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,” an Nvidia memo from December said. “In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.”

A more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk’s comment on the first-quarter Tesla call “conflicts with bookings” and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also “conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.” The email referenced news about Tesla’s ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an “H100 project” at Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory.

The new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital.

A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.

Critics have said Musk is only a part-time CEO of Tesla, the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Musk is also the CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the founder of brain-computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co. He also owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022, when it was still called Twitter. He launched his AI startup, xAI, in 2023.

X and xAI are tightly intertwined. In a post on X in November, Musk wrote, “X Corp investors will own 25% of xAI.” Additionally, xAI uses some capacity in X data centers to run some of its training and inference for the large language models behind its chatbot, called Grok, CNBC has learned.

Musk has pitched Grok, originally named Truth GPT, as a politically incorrect chatbot with “a rebellious streak” and a would-be competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other generative AI services.

While Musk juggles his many ventures, Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. The company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S., according to the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey, which attributed some of the slippage to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla’s stock price is down 29% this year.

Rather than discuss EV sales or the massive restructuring underway at Tesla, Musk has been encouraging investors to focus on future products that he’s been promising for years but has yet to deliver. That includes AI software to turn existing cars into self-driving vehicles, dedicated robotaxis that can make money for their owners, and a driverless transportation network.

“If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla’s going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,” Musk said on the April earnings call. “We will, and we are.”

To get there, he’s said, Tesla requires plenty of Nvidia’s GPUs which are specialized for AI training and workloads. Those chips are in limited supply due to soaring demand from Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and others.

‘Consuming every GPU that’s out there’

Nvidia, now the third-most-valuable company in the world with a $2.8 trillion market cap, has said it’s hard to keep up with demand. Between the cloud service providers and the companies developing AI models, customers “are consuming every GPU that’s out there,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in May, after the chipmaker reported its third straight quarter of more than 200% revenue growth.

Huang also said, on an earnings call in February, that Nvidia does its best to “allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,” adding “why allocate something when the data center’s not ready?”

In naming customers that are already using Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell platform, Huang mentioned xAI on the May call alongside six of the biggest tech companies on the planet as well as Tesla.

Musk likes to tout his infrastructure spending at both companies.

At Tesla, Musk has promised to build a $500 million “Dojo” supercomputer in Buffalo, New York, and a “super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster” at the company’s factory in Austin, Texas. The technology would potentially help Tesla develop the computer vision and LLMs needed for robots and autonomous vehicles.

At xAI, which is racing to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others in developing generative AI products, Musk is also seeking to build “the world’s largest GPU cluster” in North Dakota, with some capacity online in June, according to an internal Nvidia email from February.

The memo described a “Musk mandate” to make all 100,000 chips available to xAI by the end of 2024. It noted that the LLM behind xAI’s Grok was relying on Amazon and Oracle cloud infrastructure, with X providing additional data center capacity.

The Information previously reported some details of xAI’s data center ambitions.

On May 26, xAI said it closed a $6 billion financing round led by many of the same investors who funded Musk’s Twitter takeover. The company was incorporated in March 2023, but Tesla didn’t disclose its formation at the time, and it was four months later before Musk publicly introduced the startup.

Conflicts of interest

While Musk has said for years that Tesla is a leader in AI, he wrote in a post on X in January that he’d want more control over the company before pushing further in that direction.

“I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” he said in the post.

Tesla’s latest proxy filing indicates Musk has 20.5% of the company’s outstanding shares, a figure that includes options awarded to Musk as part of his unprecedented 2018 CEO pay package. A Delaware court has ordered that compensation to be rescinded. Post-trial proceedings are ongoing and subject to appeal.

If he is unable to reach his desired ownership mark, Musk said in the January post, he “would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” He’s already doing that at xAI.

Musk’s comments at the time rankled some longstanding bulls, including the company’s largest retail shareholder, Leo Koguan, and Gerber Kawasaki’s Ross Gerber, who characterized his demand as “blackmail.”

Joel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group, said that by letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware, Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent.

“When you have someone like Mr. Musk who is a fiduciary to multiple companies, the law recognizes this creates conflict,” Fleming said. “If you owe fiduciary duties to two or more companies that are competing over the same things, you may end up channeling corporate opportunity away from one company to another.”

Fleming, who frequently represents public company investors in shareholder disputes, said that in such situations, other executives would be in the best position to make decisions, while those who are conflicted should abstain.

“That has not historically been the path that Mr. Musk has chosen for himself,” Fleming said.

Musk hasn’t been shy about intermingling corporate resources among his companies.

For example, following his buyout of Twitter, Musk enlisted dozens of Autopilot software engineers and other technical and administrative employees from Tesla to help him make sweeping changes at the company. Some employees even work for two Musk companies at once.

At xAI, Musk has also attracted employees away from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight, and at least four other former Tesla employees who had been involved in Autopilot and big data projects there before joining the startup.

A former Tesla supply chain analyst, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters, told CNBC that Musk has always considered his companies as an extension of his persona and believed he can do whatever he wants with them. That includes Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, where he was chairman and a top shareholder.

However, the person said, redirecting a large shipment of chips from Tesla to X is extreme, given the scarcity of Nvidia’s technology. The decision means the automaker willingly gave up precious time that could have been used to build out its supercomputer cluster in Texas or New York and advance the models behind its self-driving software and robotics.

What to buy at this huge discount?,"Seeing the potential large correction coming within the coming month(s), where should I be throwing my cash reserves?

I’m seeing NVDA potentially trail back down to 75-78 within this correction and SPY move to 460’s. But what should I put my money in to get maximum value out of this huge buying opportunity? Should I just play it safe and DCA SPY or potentially double my savings quickly by nabbing NVDA at crazy cheap?

I'm expecting this dip to at least double in the coming weeks,"I'm waiting for a full correction, 25-30% retrace, at least, this week has been shocking to most people, but the signs were pretty obvious that this plane was running on low fuel

Since early February I was pretty scared of the level of gains the market was returning, completely ignoring corona virus potential,  Buffett cash pile and his conviction of a market way too expensive, WSB craze, but I was resisting the idea of timing the market

I finally did it, the last straw was the NVDA almost vertical climb and ENPH unreal post earnings pop, reminded me of the last Bitcoin climb to almost 20k, the only crash Ive experienced with an investment (ok speculation), I sold last week 70% of my protfolio, now Im waiting for a even bigger dip, 25% at least because:


-Pandemic is inminent and we are in the early stages

-We are mostly just at a 10-12% retrace, returning to mid-late 2019 prices

-Govt incompetence

-We still havent seen quarantined cities in the US

-Eventually closed borders in Europe

-A rate cut could be even more damaging to this economy, IMO it needs a full correction, but Trump will use everything in his power for a short term solution


I've resisted the impulse to get in medical stocks, or day trading, I'll just wait for the heat to cool off and panic to settle in, try to follow the ""buy when there's blood on the street""

"Intel working with bankers to present board with strategic options, sending shares up 8%","Intel executives are working with multiple advisors to formulate options to address its [flagging business](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/29/intel-intc-gelsinger-skepticism-activist-layoffs.html), according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

Those advisors, which include Morgan Stanley and other bankers, will likely present Intel’s directors with options at an upcoming board meeting in September, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. The advisors are considering a full range of options, including splitting off and selling businesses, the person said.

Intel shares rose more than 8% on the report in Friday morning trading.

[Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/intel-is-said-to-explore-options-to-cope-with-historic-slump) first reported that the company was working with its advisors to come up with strategic options. Spokespeople for Intel and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

CEO Pat Gelsinger acknowledged publicly on Thursday that the company understood investor skepticism and was working to address it.

“We realize we have to operate efficiently with nimbleness, with urgency,” Gelsinger said at Deutsche Bank’s Technology Conference. CNBC previously reported that some advisors, including Morgan Stanley, were helping the company on activism defense.

Intel remains on track to launch its next iteration of its laptop central processor, Lunar Lake, Gelsinger said at the appearance. But investors don’t see a turnaround on the horizon, and have pushed the stock down almost 60% this year.

The once-dominant company has been trounced primarily by Nvidia, which produces the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are are the heart of today’s prominent AI models.

Alongside a disastrous earnings report earlier this month, Intel announced it would lay off 15,000 workers. The job cuts, part of a broader focus on slashing expenses, did little to assuage investor dismay. And while Gelsinger said Thursday that the company’s foundry business had roughly a dozen interested customers, the buildout remains costly for Intel.

This subreddit stock picking is incredible!,"I lurk on this subreddit daily and have been doing it for the past year and let me tell you the people in this subreddit know how to pick stocks. They are so accurate that it is borderline scary. If you been lurking here for the past year then you know almost ALL of the most mentioned stocks here have skyrocketed(and I am not even talking about Tesla or Nio). I know we are in a crazy bull run right now but give credit where credit is due, this subreddit stock picking is so stunning that it makes every other investing tv show/site look like amateurs.

Some of the most mentioned stocks last year included Sea limited, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Draft kings, Cloudflare(NET), AMD, Nvidia, Square, Enphase, Microsoft, ICLN, Palantir, Alibaba, Apple, Sales force, Disney, ARKK, etc.

Ya I know trash like Hyliion is also mentioned a lot here but if you do just little DD you know they have no revenue."
Anyone going to buy more NVIDIA after recent release?,"I've made good gains from Nvidia this year. I was thinking the price is really high already before today's new release. 

This new graphics card is a literal game-changer. It's going for 500-ish and its performance is on par with the previous-generation 2000 dollar graphic card. 

I am thinking abt buy more Nvidia tmr. I want to hear what everyone thinks.

"CEO Lisa Su confirmed that AMD has been “undershipping” chips for a while now to keep CPU, GPU prices elevated","AMD is ‘undershipping’ chips to keep CPU, GPU prices elevated
Less supply to balance out demand—and keep prices high.

As the PC industry flounders, Intel suffered from such disastrous sales last quarter that it instituted pay cuts and other extreme measures going forward. AMD’s client PC sales also dropped dramatically—a whopping 51 percent year-over-year—but the company managed to eke out a small profit despite the sky falling. So why aren’t CPU and GPU prices falling too? In a call with investors Tuesday night, CEO Lisa Su confirmed that AMD has been “undershipping” chips for a while now to balance supply and demand (read: keep prices up).

“We have been undershipping the sell-through or consumption for the last two quarters,” Su said, as spotted by PC Gamer. “We undershipped in Q3, we undershipped in Q4. We will undership, to a lesser extent, in Q1.”

With the pandemic winding down and inflation ramping up, far fewer people are buying CPUs, GPUs, and PCs. It’s a hard, sudden reverse from just months ago, when companies like Nvidia and AMD were churning out graphic cards as quickly as possible to keep up with booming demand from cryptocurrency miners and PC gamers alike. Now that GPU mining is dead, shelves are brimming with unsold chips.

Despite the painfully high price tags of new next-gen GPUs, last-gen GeForce RTX 30-series and Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards are still selling for very high prices considering their two-year-old status. Strategic under-shipping helps companies maintain higher prices for their wares.

AMD isn’t the only one doing it, either.

“We’re continuing to watch each and every day in terms of the sell-through that we’re seeing,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said to investors in November. “So we have been undershipping. We have been undershipping gaming at this time so that we can correct that inventory that is out in the channel.”

Since then, Nvidia has released the $1,200 GeForce RTX 4080 and $800 RTX 4070 Ti, two wildly overpriced graphics cards, and tried positioning them as enthusiast-grade upsells over the RTX 30-series, rather than treating them like the usual cyclical upgrades. AMD’s $900 Radeon RX 7900 XT offers similarly disappointing value and the company recently released a blog post also positioning its new GPUs as enthusiast-grade upsells.

Overall gross margin is a key metric for chip companies, which burn through a ton of cash investing in R&D and cutting-edge technological processes. AMD’s market tricks helped it achieve a 51 percent non-GAAP gross margin last quarter, while Intel forecasted a terrifyingly low 34.1 percent gross margin for the upcoming quarter (hence its belt-tightening moves).

This all helps explain why street prices for standalone GPUs haven’t plummeted, even as deals on desktops and laptops have started ramping up. We expect—hope?—that as stocks dwindle down and competition ramps up, sanity will return to graphics card prices, mirroring AMD and Intel’s recent CPU price adjustments. Just this morning, Intel announced that its Arc A750 graphics card was getting a price cut to $250, instantly making it an all-too-rare tempting target for PC gamers on a budget.

Ships that have sailed and those still set to sail,"We all know the stocks and assets that have gone to the moon since the last decade or so. Big tech, Tesla, Bitcoin, NVDA, AMD, and many others. I remember trading msft around 50.00 share in 2015ish thinking this is a boring old PC company lol. 

While those stocks are still growing and going up they’re now discovered and mature in the cycle. What are some stocks that you think are at the beginning of the cycle that could set sail like the others we all know by now. The proverbial MSFTs at 50.00 or FB at ipo. And why do you see these as something we’ll see explode over the next decade?"
134 S&P 500 index stocks that have beaten the S&P 500 index,"I wanted to identify stocks that are in the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) index whose total return (with dividends reinvested) has beaten the S&P 500 index either since 1993 or since the stock's IPO (Initial Public Offering) if it was after 1993. I used the ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) SPY as my benchmark for the S&P 500 index because the web site I used to make comparisons [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY) needed an S&P 500 index ETF for comparison, and since SPY - which started in 1993 - is the oldest S&P 500 index, I used SPY and that's why the cutoff is 1993.

I used a stock screener to make a first pass filter, looking for the following criteria:

* Included in the S&P 500 index. This limited the cohort to large. profitable US companies that meet the requirements to be included in the S&P 500 index [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/) S&P 500 stocks are available as fractional shares at my brokerage Charles Schwab and at other major brokerages.
*  Pays a dividend and has a non-negative 3 year dividend Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). Companies that pay a dividend - and particularly companies that initiated paying a dividend or have been increasing their dividend - have outperformed the S&P 500 index and experienced the highest returns relative to other stocks since 1973—with significantly less volatility.  [https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends.html](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends.html)
* 5 year total return (with dividends reinvested) close to or better than the 5 year total return of the S&P 500 index. This was to help narrow down the cohort to stocks that have continued good performance in recent years, and to exclude stocks that perhaps were outperforming the S&P 500 many years ago but have been lagging the past 5 years. The 5 year total return of the S&P 500 the past 5 years is +94.69% so I used a minimum of +90% 5 year total return as a cutoff.

I then compared the total return (with dividends reinvested) of the filtered stocks and eliminated any that had a total return less than that of the S&P 500 since 1993, or since the stock's IPO if it was after 1993. Each stock was compared head-to-head against the S&P 500 index (SPY) during equal time frames. For example, this is the comparison of SPY vs MSFT [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,MSFT](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,MSFT) which had its IPO in 1986, and the comparison of SPY vs NVDA [https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,NVDA](https://totalrealreturns.com/n/SPY,NVDA) which had its IPO in 1999.

I made a spreadsheet of the 134 stocks that meet the criteria. I did this at the end of last month so the results are current as of the end of March 2024. The spreadsheet has the following columns:

* Symbol: self explanatory
* Company: self explanatory
* Total Return: the total return (with dividends reinvested) of the stock since 1993, or since the stock's  IPO if it was after 1993
* S&P 500 TR: the total return of the S&P 500 index (with dividends reinvested) during the exact same time frame displayed for the total return of the stock being compared to the S&P 500 index
* Ratio: the total return of the stock divided by the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time frame. A Ratio of 2 means the stock had 2x the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period. A Ratio of 10 means the stock had 10x the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period, and so on. Even a Ratio of 2 is significant because it means the stock had double the total return of the S&P 500 index during the same time period.
* 5 Yr Total Return: the total return of the stock the past 5 years. For comparison, the total return of the S&P 500 the past 5 years is +94.69%
* 3 Yr Div Growth Rate: the 3 year dividend Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the stock.  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) represents the year over year rate at which dividends would have grown annually if they had grown at a steady rate over the time period. Steady dividend growth - growth in dividend per share, *not* the dividend yield - is associated with company vitality and is a positive. If a stock has not been paying dividends for at least 3 years the value is blank, but that isn't a negative because it means the stock recently initiated paying a dividend, and that is associated with outperformance. [https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends/\_jcr\_content/root/readmore/readmoreresponsivegrid/mainfullgrid\_1524872/mainFull\_container/highlighter\_copy\_cop/highlighter\_container/image.coreimg.80.1280.png/1711374546518/wp106-8.png](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/insights/market-perspectives/equity/the-power-of-dividends/_jcr_content/root/readmore/readmoreresponsivegrid/mainfullgrid_1524872/mainFull_container/highlighter_copy_cop/highlighter_container/image.coreimg.80.1280.png/1711374546518/wp106-8.png)
* Dividend Yield: the current annual dividend yield

The spreadsheet can be sorted by each column to find the highest or lowest values in each column. I colored the highest values in each column in varying shades of green. The darker the shade of green the higher the value range. I did not use rigid criteria for coloring different value ranges, but looked for natural separation points or certain arbitrary values, such as >3 or >200%, etc.

Looking for stocks that are some shade of green in the Ratio AND 5 Yr Total Return AND 3 Yr Div Growth Rate columns can help identify strong performers. For example, familiar stocks like AVGO, AMAT, MSFT, and LLY are green in three columns, but so are lesser known stocks like KLAC, MPWR, PCAR and others.

The spreadsheet:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hh20ZoGg9mOamnSMZcdlOWjSIS9ppthhOI-mgQxe\_pA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hh20ZoGg9mOamnSMZcdlOWjSIS9ppthhOI-mgQxe_pA/edit?usp=sharing)

Yes, past performance is not a *guarantee* of future results, but a stock that has a documented track record of beating the S&P 500 index over an extended period of time is more likely to continue doing so than a stock that has been unable to beat the S&P 500 index over an extended period of time.

I hope this is helpful to people, especially young people looking to explore the universe of individual stocks that exists beyond ETFs."
Speculative Crap I'm Investing In So You Don't Have to,"Alright folks, mega caps and AI are all the rave but there's plenty of rather unknown companies which are growing their earning's at a tremendous rate. My portfolio in 2022 was Costco, Nvidia, Apple, Google and MSFT. They all did beautifully but they're too big for my liking now. Here's the speculative crap I'm investing in now

**1. GigaCloud Technology** \- Is like an Amazon or Alibaba but removes the consumer and does B2B ecommerce, no debt, strong cash flow, P/E ratio still reasonable for massive YoY growth. Already up a lot on this company and earning's coming up Q4 which expecting big beat.

**2.** **Vita-Coco** \- Everyone's all about Celsius or Monster, Coconut Water imo is the next best thing with a growing market, COCO, is the market leader. Summer's here, coming off winter lows and just had big beat in Q4 which normally worst quarter when its cold. Summer they partner with alcoholic brands and all the weight loss craze leads me to believe ppl are choosing healthy drink alternatives.

**3. Braze** \- Companies need a way to stay in touch with their customers, Braze creates a subscription model which handles all types of communication with customers and automates the process. This company is working its way towards becoming profitable. I was watching YT channel who interviews entrepreneurs, saw freelancer making $150k+ a year using the software to help companies so to me that's huge to see in the real world without even having looked for the company.

**4. Draft Kings** \- California and Texas still have not legalized online gambling which those two states alone are absolutely massive. Texas won't vote on it again until 2025, casino's in Oklahoma donate to Texan politicians to help influence keeping gambling out of the state but 2025 imo we see big changes. There's a huge catalyst here and earning's are growing with combat sports massively growing.

**5.** **Sofi -** The numbers don't lie. When rate cuts were plausibly announced we saw a massive jump. This company wants to run when rate cuts come but until then ppl really weary even though the numbers and guidance are phenomenal.

**6. Palantir** \- S&P500 inclusion didn't come after 5 quarters now of GAAP profitability, so in June imo we'll see it happen which is a huge catalyst. The earning's are growing as a we all know. I don't like the P/E ratio but this is a company I'd buy and immediately sell CC's on and keep selling CC""s until reaching my assigned price and repeating while holding long term.

Everyone of these companies imo has strong growing earning's, relatively unknown still compared to what everyone's piling into, and most have major catalysts coming up. COCO has summer, DK has legalization of massive states, Sofi has pending rate cuts, Palantir has sp500 inclusion, at least Braze and Giga about to report and beat as they do Q4 which should act as minor catalysts imo."
MAJOR Silicon shortage...is there a play here?,"Automakers are idling their factories...Nvidia can't come close to meeting demand for their products. Both of these industries and others rely on Silicon. Is there a play here and how do we profit?

Musk says robots could make Tesla $25 trillion company — more than half value of S&P 500 ,"The entire value of the S&P 500 currently stands at $45.5 trillion, according to FactSet. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on Thursday that his company’s Optimus humanoid robots could eventually make the automaker worth more than half of that.

Musk, who characterized himself as “pathologically optimistic” at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, said Tesla is embarking on not just a “new chapter” in its life, but is about to write an entirely “new book.” Optimus appears to be one of the main characters.

Tesla first revealed its plans to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event, trotting out a dancer in a unitard that looked like a sleek, androgynous robot.

In January, Tesla showed off Optimus robots folding laundry in a demo video that was immediately criticized by robotics engineers for being deceptive. The robots were not autonomous, but were rather being operated with humans at the controls.

At the shareholder event on Thursday, Musk didn’t divulge exactly what Optimus can do today. He suggested the robots some day will perform like R2-D2 and C-3PO in Star Wars. They could cook or clean for you, do factory work, or even teach your children, Musk suggested.

As for shareholder value, Musk said Optimus could be the catalyst for lifting Tesla’s market cap to $25 trillion someday.

Speaking to a crowd consisting mostly of fawning fanboys in an auditorium at the Gigafactory, Musk promised Tesla would move into “limited production” of Optimus in 2025 and test out humanoid robots in its own factories next year.

The company, he predicted, will have “over 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla” in 2025.

This is all far-out stuff even for Musk, who is notorious for making ambitious promises to investors and customers that don’t pan out — from developing software that can turn an existing Tesla into a self-driving vehicle with an upload, to EV battery swapping stations.

Getting to a $25 trillion market cap would mean that Tesla would be worth about eight times Apple’s value today. The iPhone maker is currently the world’s biggest company by market cap, just ahead of Microsoft.

At Thursday’s close, Tesla was valued at about $580 billion, making it the 10th most valuable company in the S&P 500.

Musk didn’t provide a timeframe for reaching $25 trillion. He did say that autonomous vehicles could get the company to a market cap of $5 trillion to $7 trillion.

Musk said he agreed with numbers from long-time Tesla bull Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest. This week, ARK put a $2,600 price target on Tesla’s stock by 2029, betting on a commercial robotaxi business that the company has yet to enter.

Wood’s price target equals a market cap for Tesla of over $8 trillion.

Musk’s comments at the annual meeting followed the shareholder vote to reinstate the CEO’s $56 billion pay plan, five months after a Delaware court ordered the company to rescind the package. The crowd cheered when the proposal was read aloud, and when preliminary results were announced.

Taking the stage following the readout of the shareholder votes, Musk said, “I just want to start off by saying hot d---! I love you guys.”

Tesla shares have dropped 27% this year as the company reckons with a sales decline that’s tied in part to an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China. The company has also implemented steep layoffs. Musk has encouraged investors to look past the current state of the business and more toward a future of autonomous driving, robots and artificial intelligence.

Among his boldest claims on Thursday was Musk’s declaration that Tesla had advanced so far in developing silicon that it’s surpassed Nvidia when it comes to inference, or the process that trained machine learning models use to draw conclusions from new data.

Nvidia shares have soared almost nine-fold since the end of 2022, driven by demand for its AI chips. The company is now worth about $3.2 trillion.

One concern swirling around Musk is his focus on Tesla given all of his other commitments. He owns and runs social media company X, is CEO of SpaceX, and founded The Boring Co. and Neuralink. He launched another startup, xAI, in March last year and the company recently raised $6 billion in venture funding.

Musk was asked by a shareholder at the meeting how important he is, personally, to the future of Tesla.

“I’m a helpful accelerant to that future,” he said, emphasizing his role in innovation.

He said that, when it comes to humanoid robots, other companies, including tech startups, are going after the market. Competitors include Boston Dynamics, Agility, Neura and Apptronik.

“What really matters is, can we be much faster than everyone else and our product be done a few years before theirs and be better,” Musk said.

Intel unveils latest AI chip as Nvidia competition heats up,"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/04/09/intel-unveils-gaudi-3-ai-chip-as-nvidia-competition-heats-up-.html

>Intel on Tuesday unveiled its latest artificial intelligence chip, called Gaudi 3, as chipmakers rush to produce semiconductors that can train and deploy big AI models, such as the one underpinning OpenAI's ChatGPT.

>Intel says the new Gaudi 3 chip is over twice as power-efficient as and can run AI models one-and-a-half times faster than Nvidia's H100 GPU. It also comes in different configurations like a bundle of eight Gaudi 3 chips on one motherboard or a card that can slot into existing systems.

>Intel said that the new Gaudi 3 chips would be available to customers in the third quarter, and companies including Dell, HP and Supermicro will build systems with the chips. Intel didn't provide a price range for Gaudi 3.

>""We are working with the software ecosystem to build open reference software, as well as building blocks that allow you to stitch together a solution that you need, rather than be forced into buying a solution,"" Sachin Katti, senior vice president of Intel's networking group, said on a call with reporters.

>Gaudi 3 is built on a five nanometer process, a relatively recent manufacturing technique, suggesting that the company is using an outside foundry to manufacture the chips. In addition to designing Gaudi 3, Intel also plans to manufacture AI chips, potentially for outside companies, at a new Ohio factory expected to open in 2027 or 2028, CEO Patrick Gelsinger told reporters last month.

Am I crazy for having 57% of my portfolio in NVIDIA? ,"As the title says, I have more than half in one stock. I know there are rules to investing, but I don't see a downside or any headwinds soon. So far I'm up quite a bit and keep buying more as it creeps higher. At 57%, I wonder if the risk is worth it?"
How do you cope with selling a stock right before it rallies another 50% or more?,"You never go broke taking profits but I feel like I missed out on a lot more profit if I had just waited one week or a couple of months to sell. Three examples I had were I bought NVDA, PLTR, and ELF in the last 6 months.  I sold all three as soon as I got a 15-25% gain all  have gone up another 50% or more.

NVDA is the most painful one since I bought it at $130 in October 2022 then panic a bit and sold when it started tanking in December 2022 at $160. I gave in to social media and Reddit saying it was too expensive and sold. It is now up 142% just 5 months later. "
"Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund","KEY POINTS

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)’s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday’s close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia’s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

“Understanding how they might be weighted, where they’re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what’s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,” Bartolini said.

The fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.

The free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.

“Its free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,” Bartolini said.

The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.

On Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.

"""Magnificent 7"" vs S&P 500?","I really don't like the *""Magnificent 7""* name at all, but since everyone has adopted it, let's just roll with it. For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: **AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA.** With a combined market cap of **more than $11 trillion**, they currently make up approx. **29% of the S&P 500's market cap.** 

The 7 giants have gained **71%** so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets. 

Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least. 

Now I know this is a ""stocks"" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&P 500 ETF.

So I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META & TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.

Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future. Nowdays it's as difficult as ever to overtake these giants, imo."

# **Stocks could be stuck in a range until there’s more proof reopenings are reviving the economy  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/stocks-could-be-stuck-in-a-range-until-theres-more-proof-reopenings-are-reviving-the-economy.html)**
*****
> Coming off a volatile week, analysts expect stocks to continue navigating choppy trading as investors try to build a view of what the economy will look like once states reopen.
*****
> Recent data on April employment and consumer spending show the worst declines in post-World War II America. More data in the coming week may reveal how the housing market fared in April, after the economy abruptly fell off a cliff when states shut down their economies in the second half of March.
*****
> Investors’ focus will also be on the government stimulus programs to help the economy and markets get through the coronavirus crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appear before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, as it reviews the government’s trillions in spending to help the economy, businesses and individuals. An interview with Powell will also air on “60 Minutes” Sunday night.
*****
> Earnings season is winding down but there are a number of reports from major retailers, like Walmart and Target, which should show that the big box stores and discounters are making out better than other retailers as consumers halted many discretionary purchases and moved more shopping online.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down nearly 2.3%, in its worst week since March 20. The S&P ended at 2,863. The Dow was off about 2.6% for the week, in its worst week since April 3. It finished the week at 23,598. The Nasdaq also had its worst week since April 3.
*****
> # Home sweet home
> “Housing is going to be important in that you’ll see the chilling effect that Covid has had on housing as well, less on construction than on sales, but on both,” said Diane Swonk, chef economist at Grant Thornton. “That’s going to be an issue. One of the key things we’re watching going forward is the credit market and housing. There’s been a real tightening of credit because of the servicers.”
*****
> Swonk said the mortgage servicers are caught in the middle between the banks and people who aren’t making their payments. She said it has been impacting lending. “That’s something we cannot afford. Housing was on a tear before, and it has to pull us out of this,” she said.
*****
> Retail sales were down 16.4% in April, and there was an unevenness of performance across the sector. The only positive category was online shopping, up 8.4%. Clothing and accessories, the types of things department stores sell, fell by 78.8% in April. Building materials and garden equipment were down just 3.5%, and that could help Home Depot and Lowe’s which report earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.
*****
> “Market reactions to the data have been somewhat muted,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. He said stocks on Friday were reacting negatively to threats from China that U.S. companies could be targeted if the U.S. does not ease up on Huawei. “The markets right now don’t need another reason to be pessimistic. It seems like both the bond market and stock market are getting a little tired. Both markets are looking for the next catalyst.”
*****
> # Solvency concerns
> The Fed has been given generally high marks for keeping markets liquid, but analysts say they are now more worried about the solvency of companies.
*****
> “There’s an interesting kind of threshold here as we’re approaching three months stay at homes or shelter in place. We’re moving from a liquidity challenge, which the Fed helped us address, to a solvency challenge,” said Michael Arone, chief market strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said unpaid bills start to pile up and default rates rise on credit cards and mortgages.
*****
> “The longer this goes on, the harder for folks to make those payments. That’s why states are eager to open even if it has some risks,” Arone said.
*****
> The Fed on Friday said the pandemic poses severe risks to businesses of all sizes and millions of households. It said there could be a sharp rise in defaults as households struggle to pay bills.
*****
> Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the Federal Reserve has removed worries about liquidity with its facilities and asset purchases. “The reality is the solvency issue which is the bigger focus of the economy and they go hand in hand with the employment issues as things that have to be addressed at some point,” he said. “Look out over the next two months, the solvency issues are based on how the economy reopens and how that medical progress looks.”
*****
> Emanuel said the Fed’s corporate bond program has helped companies refinance and clean up their balance sheet so if insolvencies become a big problem it would not be until next year. He said how the economy reopens over the next few months will determine what happens.
*****
> “The numbers are out in front of us. We do believe based on what we’re seeing so far, this is the trough of every reading we’re seeing. We do believe things are going to get better. We don’t have reason to believe that’s not the case,” he said.
*****
> Emanuel said the reopenings would be graded as a ‘B’ of ‘B+’ based on how they appear to be going so far, including the infection rates. Nearly all states have resumed some level of activity.
*****
> But the market will continue to be choppy until there is more medical progress, such as a vaccine. In a sense, the market depends on science more than ever, Emanuel said.
*****
> “If all of a sudden, we have a commercially viable vaccine in the first half of next year that’s going to be injected into peoples’ arms prior to, or well before the fall of 2021, then I do think you could make the argument the market is potentially going to hit new all time highs,” Emanuel said.
*****
> # Range bound
> For now though, he sees the market as range bound, and the S&P 500 is currently about in the middle of it.
*****
> “We have been very adamant about the definition of this market as being neither bull nor bear. It’s bounded by the 200-day moving average on the top, which is basically 3,000 and the 200-week moving average on the bottom which is 2,667 right now,” said Emanuel.
*****
> Arone agrees stocks are going to be choppy, and could react to friction. He said one source of friction is the disagreement over state reopenings, between people who want to see a reopening and those that fear a new outbreak. He said there is also friction between Republicans and Democrats.
*****
> “I think until we get clarity that the economy is open and without incident and some of these economic numbers are improving, I think the market is going to remain choppy,” he said.
*****
> Emanuel said it makes sense for the market to remain in a sideways range while different issues are resolved.
*****
> “On a valuation basis, the market is expensive but it’s not so expensive if you assume this economic period is going to be over in a couple of quarters,” Emanuel said. “If you return to growth in the third and fourth quarter which we don’t necessarily know if that’s going to be robust, but we expect it to be better next year.”
*****
> He said he expects a recovery to be more shaped like a bathtub, than like a V or a U, meaning it would be elongated on the bottom before an upturn.
*****
> “Part of what actually supports the market is this abject negativity. When everyone is already pessimistic the presumption is they’ve already done a lot of their selling so there isn’t a ton of fuel for the downside there,” said Emanuel.

# Retail Sales Telling the Economy’s Story

> Retail sales numbers for April were released today, and the basic story was no surprise. Retail sales fell a record 16.4% in April, after declining 8.4% in March, already the largest decline since the government started keeping records in 1992.

> The year-over-year decline of more than -21.6% has already topped the -11.5% seen during depths of the financial crisis, as shown in the accompanying chart. But there are hints that the decline has been heavily influenced by store closures rather than shoppers tightening their belts, and that might bode well for the future as the economy gradually starts to open up.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.15.20-Retail-Sales-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

> “One of the reasons for the major decline in retail sales is simply because many businesses are closed,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “As the economy slowly opens back up, retail sales should bounce back, as pent-up demand is there”

> For the past two months, the economy experienced an 89% decline in apparel sales and a 59.2% decline in restaurant sales. These numbers capture the effects of businesses closing. The one area of the retail sales numbers that has done relatively well? Groceries had a record April as consumers stocked up and continued to show some strength in May.

> While it will take time for retail sales to get back to normal, several factors are in play that should help support retail activity as the economy opens up. Pent-up demand is increasingly evident. Fiscal stimulus should help preserve incomes. And consumer balance sheets remain relatively healthy, with credit card debt declining the most in decades in March. While weakness will continue, April data may be the low point for retail sales, with good prospects for some strength in the second half of the year. A return to full strength will ultimately depend on the progress doctors and scientists make in limiting the dangers from COVID-19, but even the gradual opening up of the economy may show retail sales numbers starting to stabilize as early as next month.

# How Expensive Are Stocks Right Now?

> As stocks rallied 30% off the March 23 lows and earnings expectations were cut dramatically, valuations have become increasingly concerning for many investors (including some high-profile hedge fund managers being quoted in the financial press).

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the forward (next 12 months) price-to-earnings (PE) multiple for the S&P 500 Index recently eclipsed 20, which is overvalued based on historical averages and at the highest level since the tech bubble in the late 1990s.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.14.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

> While stocks look expensive on this metric—one of the reasons why we expect a correction of perhaps 10% from the April 29 highs—valuations may be getting too much attention.

> “Stocks look overvalued based on earnings estimates for the next year, which will probably fall further,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “While the return to 2019’s earnings levels may still be two years or more off, the potential for steady improvement and low interest rates suggest they may not be as stretched as they appear.”

> So how worried should investors be? Here are three reasons not to worry too much:

> * Earnings will eventually come back. This recession has an end date, and eventually we’ll beat this virus. So while earnings will take time to reach last year’s levels, they should steadily improve starting next quarter. A vaccine could accelerate the timetable.
> * Interest rates and inflation are low. A 20 PE with a sub-1% yield on the 10-year Treasury without a whiff of inflation on the horizon is not unreasonable. And Federal Reserve support isn’t going away anytime soon. In such a low-rate environment, the opportunity cost of waiting an extra year for earnings to come through is not high. Most of a stock’s value is derived from the earnings the company could generate in year two and beyond.
> * Valuations are not good short-term timing tools. There is essentially no statistical relationship between PE ratios and subsequent one-year performance for the stock market. Although we expect more volatility as the path of the economy and corporate profits becomes clearer, we also expect stocks to grow into their valuations as earnings likely recover next year.

> Stocks are expensive on traditional PE metrics, and a correction would not surprise us. But given the environment we’re in, valuations are not as worrisome as they may appear. The potential for a steady recovery in earnings over the next couple of years with low interest rates suggests that some of the valuation fears may be exaggerated.

# Why Gold Will Continue To Shine

> Gold has done quite well so far in 2020, up more than 12% year to date versus the S&P 500 Index which is down about 10%. We started to warm to the yellow metal late last year and continue to think it can serve as a potential hedge in a well-diversified portfolio for suitable investors.

> “From COVID-19, to massive monetary stimulus, to historically lower yields, to potentially negative fed funds rates down the road, there are many reasons to think gold could continue its recent strength,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold based for years before breaking out last year. This is a strong chart from a technical perspective and eventual new highs over the coming years could be quite likely.

# Retest Possible, But Bottom Likely In as Jobless Claims Trend Lower

> Initial Weekly Jobless Claims of 3.3 million, 6.9 million, 6.6 million, 5.2 million, 4.4 million, 3.8 million, 3.2 million and 3.0 million the past eight weeks, totaling 36.5 million, is astonishing. The good news is the trend is lower and as we pointed out in mid-April four weeks ago a spike peak in Initial Claims and an immediate precipitous retreat has been an effective indication of a bear market low over the years.

> Today’s chart, presented above, is from the FRED database hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis compares the recent history of Jobless claims with the Wilshire 5000. (Gaps in the Wilshire index line are market holidays.) Clearly, the March 23 low and the spike high in Claims at the end of that week correlate quite well.

# Sentiment Unexpectedly Improves

> The preliminary read on sentiment from the University of Michigan was a surprising bright spot in Friday's weak economic data as the headline reading improved from 71.8 up to 73.7 versus expectations for a decline to 68.0. Even with this increase, sentiment remains near a 10-year low, so it's not as though investors are actually positive, they're just less negative. While the increase in sentiment was a bit of a surprise, it makes sense. April was a month where the economy was essentially shut down, so the impact of that sudden stop on sentiment was intense. However, now that things have started to thaw a little bit, you can't fault people for becoming more optimistic.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH.png))**

> While consumers are feeling a bit better about the way things are, they are still extremely uneasy about the future. The chart below breaks down sentiment towards current conditions and expectations about the future. While the current conditions component showed some improvement, the expectations component saw further declines.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH-C-vs-E.png))**

> One question in the monthly survey that caused us to do a double-take was the question that asks, ""During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable changes in business conditions? And what did you hear?"" In this month's survey, the index that tracks instances of unfavorable news mentions hit a record high of 141. This series goes all the way back to 1959, and never before has it been near current levels. The prior high for this index was back in the depths of the financial crisis when the index peaked at 133. There hasn't been much good news lately, but even this reading is extreme.

# Investors Remain On Guard

> In a post earlier today, we noted that individual investors still remain overwhelmingly bearish despite the equity market's rally off the March lows. Another sentiment indicator released by TD Ameritrade supports this view that investors aren't particularly bullish right now. The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors’ portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.

> The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index has been in existence since 2010, and in that entire history there have only been five months where the index was weaker than it is now, and that was from October 2011 through February 2012. That was also a period that marked a major low in the equity market and was followed by a nearly uninterrupted three-year rally in the S&P 500.

> While the Investor Movement Index is near record lows right now, it has been weak for some time, and that weakness came even as the S&P 500 was climbing to record highs over the last 12-18 months. In other words, while investors are just about as cautious as they have been at any time in the last ten years, this conservatism is nothing new.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks."
"Packaging Deep Dive- the new battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC"," This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \[1\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \[2\], while the R&D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \[3\].

What is packaging?

The  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\[4\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.

3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.

Chiplets

Chiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in  AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\[5\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s  CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \[6\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \[7\]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you  would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it –  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete  foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \[8\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.

Chiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.

3D stacking

In  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately.

3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 \[9\],  Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago \[10\], and  TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago \[11\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\[12\] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far  behind.\[13\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \[14\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \[11\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \[15\]while Intel’s  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \[16\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent  that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \[17\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance  Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \[10\] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic –  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.

After  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you  why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future  is promising is threefold.

1. Packaging  is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.
2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \[18\]\[19\] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely  that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.
3. Intel’s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors.

If these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.

Semiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.

Feel free to contact me if there’s anything you’d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!

"Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel's 2024 outlook: Stocks and home prices will jump, interest rates will tumble, and recession won't hit","Jeremy Siegel predicts a positive outlook for 2024, with stocks and house prices set to rise, the economy avoiding a recession, and interest rates falling. The Dow reached an all-time high and Siegel's anticipation of the S&P 500 following suit signals a bullish market.   
  
He foresees a reversal favoring value and small stocks over large growth stocks. The market appears healthier as speculation around cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and fad stocks diminishes. Siegel is optimistic about quality growth stocks, such as Google, Nvidia, Tesla, and Amazon, regaining prominence.  
  
Additionally, he expects a 4% to 5% rise in housing prices in 2024 due to anticipated interest rate cuts.  
  
Despite the Federal Reserve's rate hikes, Siegel is surprised by the resilient growth of the American economy, suggesting a soft landing without a recession in 2024.

Reddit ETF progress from Jan 2021 to Jan 2024,"This [Reddit ETF post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ku6skz/reddit_etf/) was posted at the beginning of 2021, near the period of peak euphoria.  Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.  Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear here.

I felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates to see how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time did.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.  All 2024 prices use the closing price Friday.

*I used a $100,000 initial investment and just rounded all the prices to the dollar for visual simplicity (all entries use the real, full prices, I have just rounded them for this table).  This also backtracks prices from stock splits.*

Biden predicts Federal Reserve will lower interest rates,"In a speech on Friday, Biden “bet” that the Fed would be cutting interest rates soon.

It is extremely rare for a President not named Trump to comment on Federal Reserve policy. This comes after a climax run in NVDA stock and a volatile week that had the market on the cusp of a much needed pause or pullback.

Yet now, if market participants take this comment seriously and believe Biden has inside information about Powell’s plan, the market could surge higher, trapping newly minted shorts, and avert the healthy price action it needs to sustain this bull run for the longer term.

Anyone think Biden’s comments will ignite the market next week? Or will they just ignore this crazy old man?"
"Can anyone explain the theory that ""they"" (market makers/hedge funds/whoever) push a price down to avoid having to pay out for call options?","I heard a commentor somewhere mention it in passing, but they didn't explain it in detail.

They hypothesized that people would have calls on NVDA which went up a lot in the after hours last night, but that today ""they"" (market makers/hedge funds/someone?) would push the price down to avoid having to pay out for those calls.

Can someone explain this in more depth? 

Also, can someone who actually worked in an institution/hedge fund/market maker verify whether they ACTUALLY do this? It sounds very odd, is it illegal? It also seems dangerous because if they think a stock should go up, and they force the price down by SELLING TONS OF SHARES, it seems like a risky gamble because what if it doesn't work and now they have even less shares.

 I feel like when this idea gets brought up, it's always by people who have no experience working in the industry, so how would they actually know it happens? What if it's just a conspiracy like ""oh the bad guys came and pushed down the price of my stock and that's why I lost money"". 

Does anyone have links to interviews or youtube videos where industry people actually say this really happens? (No offense but if a person has never worked in the industry, how would they know that this kind of stuff happens? It would be like trusting a person with no military experience to tell you about secret strategies only people deep in the military would know)"
Has your opinion of CNBC changed after their coverage of the GME story?,"For several years like many pajama-bound investors, I have gotten up in the morning and turned on CNBC while setting up for my morning trades. 

I've always operated under the assumption that big investors run the network and are the ones with access to get invited on their shows to promote their plays. It comes with the territory knowing that every guest is on there to push an agenda, but generally, my general feeling was they aren't out to screw you over and wanted to be helpful to their viewers.

When I was learning about investing, I did value a lot of the advice they give on diversification, risk, and rising trends. I've even got some massive returns from a few ideas I got solely from watching (MSTR +132% AMZN +73%, TGT +81%, NVDA +63%).

Which takes us to this week where CNBC has been a constant whipping boy on r/wallstreetbets. 

Most of Reddit seems to completely reject CNBC's report that Melvin has [closed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html) out their short positions. If CNBC is in fact making false reports to benefit hedge funds, that is a very serious violation of trust.

I'm not sure what to think at this point. Has your trust in CNBC been shaken?"
The current hivemind and why you should be careful,"It reminds me of browsing this sub exactly 2 years ago (all over again). At that time, while we were dropping during covid the overwhelming consensus was ""This is just the beginning of the mother of all crashes"" and ""Crash? The stock has only down to where it was in 2016. We're going a lot lower, like pre-financial crisis levels""
Now I'm seeing comments going beyond the usual ""50% drop from here"" fearmongering and some people saying utterly extreme comments like ""US will actually collapse like to Roman empire. It has to someday"". 

One thing I learned in Mar. 2020 was that a lot of the bears and doomsayers also had puts. I'm not saying the market won't go down from here, but just be mindful of the agenda of people who post here and the fact they have an interest in things panning out this way. Take things with a grain of salt. Wsb was wrong before, and they'll likely be wrong again. I know this sub isn't wsb, but there's a lot of leakage. Most wsb users would also browse here obviously.

This sub also has strong herd mentality. Latching on to whatever has been going up recently (or at least hasn't going down). The new darling of the sub seems to be BRK.B for that very reason. Few months ago, it was NVDA (don't hear much about it now). Now obviously oil and commodities are what you should be in (despite having had poor returns over last decades, but yeah let's all pile in after a big spike).

Truth is, this is mostly an echo chamber of what's ""cool"" right now and telling everyone what they should've been in all along.

Remember, if we'd listened to the hivemind before, we'd have gone all in ARKK this time last year.
We'd have bought puts right before the biggest bull in run this time 2 years ago."

Intel Plans to Cut Thousands of Jobs in Face of PC Slowdown,"Intel Corp. is planning a major reduction in headcount, likely numbering in the thousands, to cut costs and cope with a sputtering personal-computer market, according to people with knowledge of the situation. 

The layoffs will be announced as early as this month, with the company planning to make the move around the same time as its third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 27, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The chipmaker had 113,700 employees as of July.

Some divisions, including Intel’s sales and marketing group, could see cuts affecting about 20% of staff, according to the people familiar with the situation.

Intel is facing a steep decline in demand for PC processors, its main business, and has struggled to win back market share lost to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. In July, the company warned that 2022 sales would be about $11 billion lower than it previously expected. Analysts are predicting a third-quarter revenue drop of nearly 20%. And Intel’s once-enviable margins have shriveled: They’re about 15 percentage points narrower than historical numbers of around 60%. 

During its second-quarter earnings call, Intel acknowledged that it could make changes in its business to improve profits. “We are also lowering core expenses in calendar year 2022 and will look to take additional actions in the second half of the year,” Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said at the time. 

Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, declined to comment on the layoffs.

Intel’s last big wave of layoffs occurred in 2016, when it trimmed about 12,000 jobs, or 11% of its total. The company has made smaller cuts since then and shuttered several divisions, including its cellular modem and drone units. Like many companies in the technology industry, Intel also froze hiring earlier this year, when market conditions soured and fears of a recession grew.

Gelsinger took the helm at Intel last year and has been working to restore the company’s reputation as a Silicon Valley legend. But even before the PC slump, it was an uphill fight. Intel lost its long-held technological edge, and its own executives acknowledge that the company’s culture of innovation withered in recent years.

Now a broader slump is adding to those challenges. Intel’s PC, data center and artificial intelligence groups are contending with a tech spending slowdown, weighing on revenue and profit.

PC sales tumbled 15% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to IDC. HP Inc., Dell Technologies Inc, and Lenovo Group Ltd., which use Intel’s processors in their laptops and desktop PCs, all suffered steep declines.

It’s a particularly awkward moment for Intel to be making cutbacks. The company lobbied heavily for a $52 billion chip-stimulus bill this year, vowing to expand its manufacturing in the US. Gelsinger is planning a building boom that includes bringing the world’s biggest chipmaking hub to Ohio. 

At the same time, the company is under intense pressure from investors to shore up its profits. The company’s shares have fallen more than 50% in 2022, with a 20% plunge occurring in the last month alone.

US tensions with China also have clouded the chip industry’s future. The Biden administration announced new export curbs on Friday, restricting what US technologies companies can sell to the Asian nation.

David Zinsner, Intel’s chief financial officer, said after the company’s latest quarterly report that “there are large opportunities for Intel to improve and deliver maximum output per dollar.” The chipmaker expected to see restructuring charges in the third quarter, he said, signaling that cuts were looming.

Some chipmakers, including Nvidia Corp. and Micron Technology Inc., have said they’re steering clear of layoffs for now. But other tech companies, such as Oracle Corp. and Arm Ltd., have already been cutting jobs.

Infamous letter from Sun Microsystems CEO to shareholders after DotCom burst,"Sun peaked at a $200bn market cap in 2000 & then crashed and was finally sold for $7bn to Oracle a decade later. Their Price to Revenue ratio at the peak was only 10!

They had actual decent revolutionary products too: 
From Java programming language to SPARC processors, StarOffice, MySQL, Solaris OS, VirtualBox & ZFS!
They were involved in all important areas of tech.

This is what the CEO wrote to bagholders:

“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?” 

Little he knew... NVDA with Price to Revenue of 28 is on sale!

Edit: I should add, NVDA earnings has shrunk 53% YoY, growth stock? No, shrink stock at the moment."

"Intel awarded up to $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act grants, with billions more in loans available","https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/20/intel-awarded-up-to-8point5-billion-from-chips-act-with-loans-available.html

The White House said Intel has been awarded up to $8.5 billion in CHIPS Act funding, as the Biden administration ramps up its effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing to U.S. soil.

Intel could receive an additional $11 billion in loans from the CHIPS and Science Act, which was passed in 2022. The awards will be announced by President Joe Biden in Arizona on Wednesday.

The money will help “leading-edge semiconductors made in the United States” keep “America in the driver’s seat of innovation,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said on a call with reporters. Intel and the White House said their agreement is nonbinding and preliminary and could change.

Intel has long been a stalwart of the U.S. semiconductor industry, developing chips that power many of the world’s PCs and data center servers. However, the company has been eclipsed in revenue by Nvidia, which leads in artificial intelligence chips, and has been surpassed in market cap by rival AMD and mobile phone chipmaker Qualcomm.

Even with its slide relative to its peers, Intel is uniquely situated in the industry because it operates chip factories, or fabs, in addition to designing processors. AMD and Nvidia, are fabless, which means they design the chip, then send computer files and staff to Taiwan’s TSMC for the manufacturing of the device.

TSMC has dominated the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing in recent years, so all of the world’s fastest processors are physically built in Taiwan.

That’s a big reason why Intel was long expected to be one of the largest beneficiaries of the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act, which targeted the unlocking of nearly $53 billion in incentives for domestic chip technology. A key motivation behind the CHIPS Act was to encourage companies to build fabs on U.S. soil to prevent a supply disruption should China ever invade Taiwan.

Intel said it would spend its CHIPS Act funds on fabs and research centers in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. The company previously announced plans to spend $100 billion on U.S. programs and facilities. Intel has announced a plan to catch up in leading-edge manufacturing by 2026.

Intel’s Ohio fab will cost more than $20 billion and Intel said it is expected to start production in 2027 or 2028. Intel is also expanding manufacturing operations in Arizona and New Mexico. Intel says the projects will create jobs for 20,000 people in fab construction and 10,000 people in chip manufacturing.

The Ohio fab will make AI chips for Intel as well as potentially fabricate AI chips for other semiconductor companies, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with reporters.

“Go drive by the Ohio site,” Gelsinger said. “There are a whole lot of cranes and concrete job trucks that are building what we believe will become the premier manufacturing location, at scale, particularly for AI chips in America.”

GlobalFoundries, Microchip, and BAE Systems have already received CHIPS Act money, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. TSMC is expected to receive CHIPS Act funds for a fab in Arizona that will be used for Apple and AMD chips."
Ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt sees Nvidia as big AI winner: ‘You know what to do in the stock market’,"I'm not looking for another debate about whether Nvidia deserves its valuation -- we've had tons of threads about that already. What I'm curious about is:

* What is your opinion of Eric Schmidt? Is he generally a trustworthy industry insider? Do you trust his opinions on this matter? (I looked for his name on this sub and it's rarely mentioned).

* If you don't trust him, what might be his motives for these comments? For example, is it perhaps to indirectly pump up his own Alphabet stock, which is probably #2 behind Nvidia and will benefit from big AI wave. (He owns 147 million shares)

Here's [link to the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/eric-schmidt-on-nvidia-you-know-what-to-do-in-the-stock-market.html) with some juicy bits:

* “I’m talking to the big companies, and the big companies are telling me they need $20 billion, $50 billion, $100 billion — very very hard,” said Schmidt, adding that he’s a “close friend” to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

* “If $300 billion is all going to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market,” Schmidt said. “That’s not a stock recommendation.” Schmidt didn’t say if he owns Nvidia shares.

* Schmidt, who was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 and remained on the board until 2019, was addressing a class of undergraduates on the topic of AI. He told the Wall Street Journal that he requested the video to be taken down because he had misspoken about Google’s lax work culture in the session.

* Schmidt suggested Nvidia won’t be the only winner in AI, but there aren’t a lot of other obvious choices. He said that he currently believes big companies who can invest more money into Nvidia chips and data centers will gain a technological lead over smaller competitors that can’t spend as freely.

* “At the moment, the gap between the frontier models — there are only three — and everyone else appears to be getting larger,” Schmidt said. “Six months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller, so I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I’m not so sure.”

* Schmidt said it will be difficult for competitors to catch up with Nvidia because many of the most important open source tools that AI developers use are based on the company’s CUDA programming language. He said AMD’s software that translates Nvidia’s CUDA code for its own chips “doesn’t work yet.”

* Schmidt, who started venture firm Innovation Endeavors in 2010, still holds about 147 million shares of Alphabet, according to Bloomberg, valued at about $24 billion. In addition to startup investing, he has been a philanthropist and advised several government committees on technology."
"Amazon to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a rival to ChatGPT developer OpenAI","E-commerce giant Amazon on Monday said it will invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic and take a minority ownership position in the company.The move underscores Amazon’s aggressive AI push as it looks to keep pace with rivals such as Microsoft and Alphabet’sGoogle.

Anthropic was founded roughly two years ago by former OpenAI research executives and recently debuted its new AI chatbot called Claude 2. Amazon is looking to capitalize on the hype and promise of so-called generative AI, which includes technology like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, as well as Anthropic’s Claude chatbots.

The two firms on Monday said that they are forming a strategic collaboration to advance generative AI, with the startup selecting Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. Anthropic said it will provide AWS customers with early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning capabilities.

Anthropic will also use custom AWS-designed semiconductors to train the foundational models that underpin its AI applications. Foundation models are large AI programs trained on vast amounts of data so that they can be adapted to solve a wide range of tasks. 

This year, chip firm Nvidia is the chip firm that has seen the biggest gains from the generative AI boom. Nvidia’s key product is a type of semiconductor known as a graphics processing unit, which can be used to train huge AI models. At one point Nvidia’s stock had rallied more than 200%, as the company smashed through financial forecasts on the rising adoption of AI.

To an extent, Amazon’s deal with Anthropic aims to show that there are alternative chips that can be used for AI applications. AWS customers will be able to build on Anthropic’s AI models via Amazon Bedrock — a service that lets customers build generative AI applications in the cloud via existing models, rather than train their own models.

Amazon is looking to position itself as the one-stop shop for AI. The e-commerce giant designs its own chips for training huge AI models. Through Amazon Bedrock customers can also design their own generative AI applications using existing models, which are all run on the Amazon cloud. The company sells its own AI applications too.

Anthropic already counts some high-profile backers, including Google and Salesforce Ventures. This support comes as tech giants continue to make massive bets on AI companies, a move sparked by Microsoft’s multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI in January.

Investors Are Bailing on Cathie Wood’s Popular ARK Fund.,"
Cathie Wood’s flagship exchange-traded fund has rallied more than 50% this year. Investors are using that as an opportunity to get out.

They have pulled a net $717 million from the ARK Innovation ETF over the past 12 months, according to FactSet. That exodus marks a notable shift for a fund that had consistently drawn investor cash since its 2014 inception. Once the largest actively managed ETF with nearly $30 billion in assets under management, the fund has shrunk to roughly $9 billion, mostly due to investment losses.

Known by its ticker symbol ARKK, Wood’s fund became an investor darling shortly after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic with hugely successful bets on unprofitable and “disruptive” technology companies. It took in huge amounts of investor money, culminating with a $6.5 billion inflow in the first quarter of 2021, when its share price peaked.

Then, the Federal Reserve’s fastest interest-rate hiking campaign in decades crushed the valuations of unprofitable growth companies, which often attract investors when interest rates are low and returns on safer investments such as CDs are minimal. Shares of ARKK plunged 67% in 2022, but its investors largely held on or bought the dip. Now, analysts say they expect some of those investors are getting out for good.

“You have a whole group of people who got in somewhere near the top and are sitting on horrific losses,” said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Capital Management, which operates an inverse ETF that lets investors bet against Wood’s fund. “I think some of those people have said, ‘I’m never getting back to even; this is probably the best I’m going to do, and it’s time to get out.’”

Wood says the outflows have been small compared with the fund’s assets.

“We have been astonished at our asset retention since February of ‘21,” Wood said in an interview. “It’s a very small number as a percentage of assets, which suggests that it’s far more likely to be people who are taking some profits than some exodus of people who have stayed in the fund through a prolonged down period.”

Despite the recent rally, ARKK shares are trading about 70% below their all-time high. The S&P 500 has climbed 17% this year on hopes the Fed is near the end of its tightening effort; it is still down 6.1% from its early 2022 high.

ARKK’s top five holdings are Tesla, Coinbase Global, Roku, Zoom Video Communications and Block. Only Tesla and Zoom were profitable last year. Tesla holds an 11% weight in the fund, helping power its advance this year. Shares of the electric-vehicle maker have more than doubled in 2023 but, like ARKK, are down sharply from their previous high.

Although technology stocks are strongly back in favor this year, the best performers have mostly been mature, profitable companies that generate significant cash, such as Microsoft and Amazon.com. Unlike two years ago, investors appear to have less interest and patience for companies that aren’t expected to turn a profit until years in the future. Higher interest rates have meant there is a much higher opportunity cost to wait for profitability.

“There’s certainly been a change in sentiment from when the ARK funds were doing really well,” said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA Research. “A lot of the stocks the ETF holds won’t have big cash flows until way out in the future, and it’s a more challenging environment for that with rates expected to be higher for longer.”

Investors say the ARK brand lost its luster after the fund’s prodigious fall. It took another hit after missing out on the monster rally in shares of Nvidia, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the boom of interest in artificial-intelligence technology. ARKK sold the last of its Nvidia position in January, a stake that had long been one of its largest holdings. Nvidia has been the S&P 500’s best performer this year, more than tripling.

“The bloom is off the rose a little bit,” Tuttle said.

Wood says the negative publicity over the past two years has been an opportunity for ARK to solidify its brand as an asset manager focused on disruptive innovation.

“I can tell you at the end of ’20 and early ‘21, when we couldn’t do anything wrong and people were just chasing, I felt very uncomfortable,” she said. “Today, I feel very comfortable. We are not seeing that kind of behavior. That tells me there is a wall of worry out there. And that usually sustains a bull market.”

The outflows at ARK are coming while ETF investors appear eager to put money to work in other funds. June was the best month for equity ETF flows since October, according to State Street, while active funds attracted $10 billion of inflows for the month and more than $100 billion over the past 12 months.

Investors displayed “childlike exuberance” and “jumped into the market’s rally with both feet,” Matthew Bartolini, head of Americas research for State Street’s ETF business, said in a research note.

The ARKK fund has an 11% annualized average return since inception, but the average ARKK investor has lost 21% on a dollar-weighted, annualized basis, according to FactSet.

“ARKK shareholders have not timed their purchases well. Many bought high and have yet to sell,” said Elisabeth Kashner, director of global funds research at FactSet.

The fund remains a cash cow for Wood, who owns a majority stake in its parent company, ARK Investment Management. Its 0.75% annual fee is about double the average fee for active ETFs.

Although fee revenue is well off its 2021 peak, ARKK has generated more than $20 million of fees this year. ARK Investment Management currently has the third-highest daily revenue from active equity ETFs, of at least 145 different issuers, according to an analysis from FactSet.

To be sure, the market comeback staged by many of ARKK’s tech-focused holdings surprised many, highlighting the perils of trying to forecast performance.

“If you just look at rates, you would not have expected this great rebound in growth coming into the year,” said Dana D’Auria, co-chief investment officer at Envestnet. “It’s a classic window into why market prognostication doesn’t work. Who would have thought artificial intelligence would boom and create this massive interest?”

Intel stock sinks as early 2024 outlook comes up short,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html)

Intel shares dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates.  
  
Here’s how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December:  
  
Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected  
Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected

  
For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue.  
  
Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year.  
  
With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue.  
  
Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street.  
  
Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia’s recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs.  
  
Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips.  
  
Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022.  
  
Intel’s largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.  
  
Intel’s second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs.  
  
Intel foundry services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase."
"Intel claims on track to regain foundry leadership from TSMC in 2025, secures ""large customer"" for 18A node tech","https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-claims-on-track-to-regain-foundry-leadership-from-TSMC-in-2025-secures-large-customer-for-18A-node-tech.745986.0.html

""To achieve this, Gelsinger told the conference that Intel is on track with its manufacturing roadmap of 5 nodes in four years, regaining process leadership in 2025 with the 18A node, as reported by Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin. Gelsinger added that following on from Meteor Lake (expected to be launched later this month), Intel will be ramping its Intel 3 process (5 nm) “soon”. Perhaps more excitingly – and tantalizingly – Gelsinger said that Intel has received a large customer pre-payment for its 18A node (1.8 nm) that has already been successfully taped out and is on track for 2025.

One can only speculate as to which company this “large customer” is. TSMC also claims it is on track for its own 2 nm process node in 2025 and already enjoys the patronage of major customers including Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, MediaTek along with Apple. Undoubtedly, Intel will be keen to secure at least one of these companies as it helps with its own economies of scale as investing in each of these new process nodes is a multi-billion-dollar endeavor. In the end, the competition in the foundry sector is great for customers as it is driving the delivery of faster, but also more efficient chips."""
People who made high-conviction buys into NVDA or AMD years ago -- what was your process?,"We often hear stories here about how people got into AMD or NVDA at $10. That's fantastic but I would like to know:

> **How did you find these great buys and can we duplicate your process?**

And

> **Using that same method, what current stocks look like the next AMD or NVDA (before they mooned)?**

We're especially interested in stories that describe a great research method that hopefully we can duplicate.

A couple of caveats:

* You can share other stories that's not AMD or NVDA, but try to keep it in the tech growth sector if possible.

* Try to avoid stories of ""Well it was so cheap so I just Yolo"" or ""I heard it on Reddit."" That's great for you but it's not a process we can duplicate. Remember, it must be a ""high conviction"" buy for you, not just a random dart throw."
NVDA may surpass AMZN within weeks,"Wild times guys. To summarize, NVDA reported super bullish guidance for coming quarters, average yearly estimate was $30B in revenue, which may now be somewhere between $40B-$50B. We will be seeing lot of upgrades from analysts in coming days. I am still puzzled as to how this was already not priced on with almost 100% run in last 6 months alone. Now stock is up another 26%.

Amazon will be doing ~$550B in revenue in 2023 alone with low teen growth next year. And their market cap is between $1T-$1.1T.

Can someone help me understand how NVDA has such a low short interest at these level? And literally everyone thinks this all makes sense? (Excluding redditors) i am talking about institutional investors, because at these level, they are the one moving the needle. And they clearly loading this up big time. At least for TSLA when it went on this insane run, there was lot of short interest, then S&P 500 inclusion hype, stock split, EV demand surge and 0% interest rate. 

Trying to figure out what these fund managers are seeing for bull case for NVDA."
43 years old and I just invested in stocks for the first time in my life,"Hi everyone!

I decided to post here because I'm anxious, scared, and excited at the same time because I finally saved up some money and invested it for the first time.  I quit drinking beer and buying useless crap, and saved up (don't laugh) $1,000 dollars and had it sitting there in a credit union with pennies for interest and I didn't like that.  

I'm really kicking myself for not doing this when I was younger.  I remember when I was in my mid 20's ""this close"" to making a brokerage account and getting started, and I never did it.  Did this scare any of you the first time you got in to trading?  

The first share I bought was 1 full share in the Vanguard VGT ETF.  I know it sounds dumb, but it was pretty scary and exciting at the same time.  My position is focusing 80% ETFs and sprinkle in some individual stocks to play around with.  

My primary goal is dividends and compound reinvesting, in the hopes that I can have a nice-ish passive income 20-30 years from now.  I'm wondering what you guys think of my current positions:

**ETFs:** VGT, VONG, VTI, SCHD, and SCHG

**Stocks** *(I bought fractions of these)*:  AAPL, AMZN, HD, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, O, RTX, WM, WMT

That was my attempt of diversifying.  I have been reading until my eyes bleed, and I really have no idea if what I'm doing is considered smart or not.  But for the first time, checking my portfolio today.. seeing I'm up 1.24% with everything in green (short of stupid Wal\*Mart)...  

I'm up a whopping $10!  And I think that's pretty cool!!!  Now how in the hell do I make that **bajillions**?

After 4 years of investing into single stocks: it’s not about financial education but all about psychology and luck ,"In early 2020, at age 21,  I started to invest in the stock market by picking single stocks that I analysed through  thorough due diligence (mostly fundamental). During that time I just finished my bachelors degree in International Business and now I am on the verge of finishing my masters degree in Finance & Banking. Since I was 15-16 years old I always had an interest in the stock market and finance topics in general. Also I always considered myself to be really good with mathematical and statistical concepts, so all in all I thought that I must have an edge on the „regular“ investor in terms of not necessarily being better of just putting my money into index funds. 

Now after 4 years of investing I realised that I was wrong and the typical advice to just invest into an s&p500 or world etf applies to me as well. Over the 4 years I can account for returns around 22% on my portfolio (not per year but over the whole time span), massively underperforming S&P return during the same timespan. So, on the first of January I started to reallocate my funds by investment a fixed amount into an vanguard s&p500 and all world etf bi-monthly and I couldn’t be happier with my decision. 

Half a year into implementing the strategy shift, I already accumulated a 4-5% return on those etfs and didn’t stress a bit along the way. No reading financial statements and listening to earnings calls for hours. No spreadsheet nightmares, no waking up and checking the market every hour till I go to sleep. 

So yeah I know, what I realised is what everybody keeps preaching since the early days of investing but I had to experience it myself and get humbled to know for myself. Even though I have the knowledge when it comes to finance, mathematics, statistics etc. it seems like this is just the barrier to entry. From that point onwards buying and selling single stocks is 90% and mental game as well as some necessary luck. So a lot of the times I picked the right stocks but failed to stick to simple investment rules, and human biases got the better of me. I kept stocks that underperformed in hopes of getting back in the green And sold of stocks I believed in just to realise gains (e.g. selling Nvidia at 160 bc I already doubled the initial investment) 

I hope someone reading this may benefit from hearing my investment history and reflects on if picking single stocks is really worth it 🙏🏼

EDIT: 

It’s crazy how one single post which is just summarising my personal experience got the people of this sub visibly divided into 2 camps:
The first consisting of people who agree and/or congratulate me to my personal realisation. The second being people who feel the need to flame me for my experience, decisions, educational background etc.

So just to make it clear:


NO, I’m not thinking that I know a lot about stock market mechanisms! In fact, over the past 4
Years I gradually became more and more aware of the fact that, for me, learning all about it is not worth it. 

NO, I wasn’t trying to generalise or say that picking stocks is a bad choice no matter the person. 

YES, I was just talking about myself, and the fact the I, as a person, am prone to human biases and that psychological errors led me to screw up good investments

YES, I believe there are tons of people who are capable of beating the market, it’s just not for everyone

Tesla Finally Dumps NVIDIA Claims Their Own Chip is Better,"The Immediate Impact

We have been reporting for years that Tesla would be building their own custom chips since they hired Jim Keller in 2016 and licensing IP from AMD. These chips being already in the cars would mean an immediate drop in orders from NVIDIA, at over 5000 cars a week the revenue will be missed. This move provides Tesla with more flexibility in how they control their network and self-driving mechanisms while also reducing the costs to make the vehicles, aiding the companies goal of lowering manufacturing cost for the Model 3.

"Does anyone else find it ironic how many people say ""Buy the dip"" until the dip actually comes?","The number of bears within every comment section is actually pretty hilarious right now. Everyone seems to be a self-proclaimed expert on where the bottom will be. I have actually seen multiple comments saying they sold a while ago, but that they'd ""wait for it to go lower"". 

I've also seen so much talk about how companies are well above their fair valuation. This talk definitely didn't exist a month ago, and for right reasons. With a few exceptions, it's almost impossible to find a company within the top 10 and even top 20 that sits at an unjust valuation. There are a lot of companies in fact that are far below what I would consider to be a fair valuation. For example, Nvidia down 10% this week despite beating expectations by a large margin and releasing guidance for even higher earnings next quarter."

"Intel heads for worst day on Wall Street in 50 years, falls to lowest in over a decade ","Intel shares plunged the most in 50 years on Friday, reaching a price not seen since 2013, after the chipmaker reported a big earnings miss and announced a massive restructuring.

The stock plummeted 27% to $21.22 as of late morning trading. It would be the second worst day ever for the shares, behind only a 31% drop in July 1974, which was three years after Intel’s IPO. The company’s market cap is now below $100 billion.

The dramatic selloff contributed to a 2.4% drop in the Nasdaq and pulled down global semiconductor stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — known as TSMC — closed 4.6% lower in Taiwan, and Samsung was down more than 4% at the end of the session in South Korea. TSMC is the world’s biggest manufacturer of chips, while Samsung is the largest memory semiconductor firm globally.

Intel’s numbers were bad across the board.

The company swung to a $1.61 billion net loss after reporting net income of $1.48 billion in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings per share of 2 cents fell way short of the average analyst estimate of 10 cents, according to LSEG. Revenue also missed expectations.

Intel said it won’t pay its dividend in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 and lowered its forecast for full-year capital expenditures by over 20%. The company said it would lay off more than 15% of its employees as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.

“This is the most substantial restructuring of Intel since the memory microprocessor transition four decades ago,” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told CNBC’s Jon Fortt in an interview that aired on Friday. “We have laid out an audacious journey of rebuilding this company, and we’re going to get that done.”

A decision to more rapidly produce Core Ultra PC chips that can handle artificial intelligence workloads contributed to the loss, Gelsinger said on a conference call with analysts. The company said pricing was more competitive than planned during the quarter, as AMD, Qualcomm and other companies have been working to take market share from Intel, which has fallen way behind its rivals in the AI battle.

The job cuts will mainly take place this year, Gelsinger wrote in a memo. It’s the largest of any single job cut listed on Layoffs.fyi, an industry tracker that’s been operating since March 2020.

Competing on merit

Adding pressure to the chip sector is a report from The Information that AI chipmaker Nvidia is the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust investigation.

The DOJ is looking at complaints that the company allegedly abused its market dominance in AI, The Information reported.

In response, a spokesperson for Nvidia said that the company “wins on merit.”

“We compete based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws, making NVIDIA openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise, and ensuring that customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,” the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson added that Nvidia is “happy to provide any information regulators need.”

CNBC has also reached out to the DOJ on the report.

Samsung rival SK Hynix, which supplies U.S. giant Nvidia, also fell sharply to close more than 10% lower. The sell-off continued in Europe. Shares of ASML, which sells key tools required to make cutting-edge chips, declined along with STMicroelectronics and Infineon.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF, which includes major names in the sector, fell more than 4% on Friday after plummeting 6.5% a day earlier.

Recent Intel Gaming Chips have >50% Failure Rate,"It has been known for months that Intel's consumer desktop chips of the 13th and 14th generation are widely affected by stability problems. It was thought that these issues were caused by motherboard vendors pushing the chips above the voltage intended by Intel and this was what was causing the chips to fail.

I'm mostly making this post because I have not seen this being reported on outside of niche tech circles. Couldn't this mean a huge recall operation for Intel? A company already struggling to profit losing (tens-hundreds of)millions on a recall that also hurts consumer trust. I mean, as far as I understand the findings, this means all high-powered consumer chips Intel has sold for the last 2 years are slowly degrading and a lot of them could fail.

BlackRock and Microsoft plan $30bn fund to invest in AI infrastructure,"  
[https://www.ft.com/content/4441114b-a105-439c-949b-1e7f81517deb](https://www.ft.com/content/4441114b-a105-439c-949b-1e7f81517deb)

BlackRock is preparing to launch a more than $30bn artificial intelligence investment fund with technology giant Microsoft to build data centres and energy projects to meet growing demands stemming from AI.  

The financial partnership, which BlackRock is launching with its new infrastructure investment unit, Global Infrastructure Partners, would be one of the biggest investment vehicles ever raised on Wall Street. Microsoft and MGX, the Abu Dhabi-backed investment company, are general partners in the fund. Nvidia, the fast-growing chipmaker, will advise on factory design and integration. 

The investment vehicle is aimed at addressing the staggering power and digital infrastructure demands of building AI products that are expected to face severe capacity bottlenecks in coming years. The computing power of AI requires far more energy than previous technological innovations and has strained existing energy infrastructure. 

Dubbed the Global AI Investment Partnership, the effort seeks to raise up to $30bn in equity investments and leverage that to support up to an additional $70bn in debt financing. 

The fund would mark GIP’s first big fund since the private infrastructure investment group agreed to be acquired by BlackRock for $12.5bn earlier this year. That deal is due to close in October.

BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, has highlighted the energy sector as one of its top opportunities for growth. “Mobilising private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centres and power will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity,” Larry Fink, BlackRock chief executive, said in a statement.

The soon-to-be launched fund is the latest vehicle created by a large asset manager to meet the ever-growing demand for energy to power generative AI and cloud computing. Earlier this year Microsoft agreed to back $10bn in renewable electricity projects built by Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management. Microsoft has made a commitment to ensure 100 per cent of its energy consumption is matched by zero carbon energy purchases by 2030.  

“The country and the world are going to need more capital investment to accelerate the development of the AI infrastructure needed. This kind of effort is an important step,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president. 

MGX was created earlier this year with the backing of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala to advance the country’s progress in AI. It has been in talks to invest in Open AI’s next funding round. 

In 2017, Blackstone announced plans for a $40bn infrastructure vehicle with backing from Saudi Arabia, and Brookfield last year raised $28bn for what was described as the largest ever infrastructure fund. 

The International Energy Agency estimates that global electricity consumption by data centres could surpass 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2026, more than twice the amount used in 2022.  Recommended LexBig Tech Data centres have turned Big Tech into big spenders Premium content 

“Accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a growing need for AI infrastructure for the next industrial revolution,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder, said in a statement. 

In the US, which hosts one-third of the world’s data centres, electricity demand is rising rapidly for the first time in two decades, driven partly by these energy-intensive facilities. A report from Grid Strategies indicates that five-year projections for electricity demand growth in the US have nearly doubled over the past year, increasing from 2.6 per cent to 4.7 per cent. 

“There is a clear need to mobilise significant amounts of private capital to fund investments in essential infrastructure,” Bayo Ogunlesi, GIP’s chief executive, said in a statement."
What companies are currently undervalued?,"Hey, I just sold off 60% of the Nvidia position I've had since 2022, and I am now looking for a new good value-good growth company. Most of my holdings (around 65%) are in ETFs but the other part is in companies, which at the moment are Eli Lily, Microsoft, Rio Tinto & NVidia (Nvidia got trimmed because it got too dominant in my portfolio, and I wanted to take some profits).

Do you guys have any advice on which companies or sectors to look at? This Sub gave me multiple ideas in the past and most of them have worked, so I am curious about your current opinions.

Nvidia and Johnson & Johnson to develop new AI applications for surgery,"Johnson & Johnson on Monday announced it is working with Nvidia to develop and scale new artificial intelligence applications for surgery. 

J&J’s MedTech unit and Nvidia plan to integrate AI within devices and platforms from pre-op to post-op to help ensure that surgeons have access to all the information they need, Nvidia’s vice president of health care Kimberly Powell said. For instance, the companies are using AI to analyze surgical video and automate the time-consuming documentation required after a procedure. 

“There’s an ability to use all the sources of data inside an operating room, whether it’s your voice, or whether it’s the video coming from a camera inside the body, or elsewhere, to take advantage of the generative AI moment that we’re in,” Powell told CNBC in an interview. 

The MedTech unit at J&J creates tools and solutions for conditions such as heart failure, kidney disease and stroke, and its technology is used in more than 75 million procedures each year, the company told CNBC. Powell said Nvidia has worked in medical devices and imaging for more than a decade. 

Shan Jegatheeswaran, vice president and global head of digital at J&J MedTech, said just one minute of surgical video is equivalent to roughly 25 CT scans, so having the compute power and infrastructure to annotate and share those videos widely will be powerful for surgeons.

In the short term, he said de-identifying and enhancing the video can help educate and train surgeons. In the long term, analytics can be layered on top of video to provide real-time decision support. More accessible surgical video means residents will not have to solely depend on the insight and availability of the more experienced physicians at their institutions. 

“Think about athletes. They look at game tape, and they get better over time as they look at themselves,” Jegatheeswaran told CNBC in an interview. “That’s sort of the starting point. That’s the holy grail in the short term.”

Powell said the collaboration is in the “early innings,” and many applications will take time to fine-tune and implement safely. However, she said nondiagnostic use cases such as automating paperwork will help save surgeons time and make a difference “right out of the gate.”

“I think all of us as patients should get really excited about the fact that this kind of technology is going to be able to enter in and be within reach of all the clinicians and all the hardworking nurses and all the health-care staff,” Powell said. “They’re going to have the very best tools and information at their disposal.”

"Dell beats estimates as server sales soar 80%, riding AI wave ","Dell reported quarterly results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, powered by an 80% increase in server sales. The stock rose more than 5% in extended trading.

Here’s how the company did for the fiscal second quarter vs. LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: $25.06 billion vs. $24.53 billion expected

EPS: $1.89 adjusted, vs. $1.71 expected

Net income climbed 85% to $841 million, or $1.17 per share, from $455 million, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue increased about 9% from $22.93 billion a year ago.

Dell typically provides investors with a forecast on its analyst call. Earlier this year, the company told investors to expect revenue between $93.5 billion and $97.5 billion for the full year, up from $88.4 billion in the prior year.

Dell has emerged as a top vendor for servers that can handle artificial intelligence workloads, especially those based around Nvidia chips, as demand skyrockets from cloud providers. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called out Dell founder Michael Dell as the person to contact to place orders for systems that include the company’s new chips.

Dell shares are up 48% so far this year, but have slumped 34% since the company’s last report.

AI sales are in the company’s Infrastructure Solutions Group, which makes servers and systems for data centers. It’s the company’s fastest-growing unit. Overall ISG sales rose 38% to $11.65 billion, ahead of StreetAccount expectations of $10.44 billion.

The standout in Dell’s report was Servers and Networking revenue, which includes both AI-oriented servers based around GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, as well as more traditional servers for older applications. It’s part of ISG.

The unit reported $7.76 billion in sales, rising 80% on an annual basis, and beating StreetAccount expectations of $6.37 billion. Dell said $3.1 billion of that was AI server sales, up from $1.7 billion in the May quarter.

Dell operating chief Jeff Clarke attributed the increase in revenue to server demand that continues to rise, and said in a statement that there was an increasing “backlog” of $3.8 billion in AI server orders that haven’t been fulfilled yet. There’s also a multibillion-dollar “pipeline” of AI server deals from enterprises and cloud providers that haven’t been finalized.

However, Dell’s storage business, also part of ISG, fell 5% to $4 billion in sales.

Dell’s Client Solutions Group, which focuses on PCs and laptops, declined 4% on an annual basis to $12.41 billion in revenue. Consumer sales fell 22% to $1.86 billion, and the company’s enterprise PC business was flat at $10.55 billion in sales.

Dell said that it spent $1 billion in the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.

Most stocks hyped as winners from AI boom have fallen this year,"Source: https://www.ft.com/content/1e02d0d3-3f0b-4bd1-a79c-9fd45d1b6056

Most of the stocks that were caught up in last year’s hype around artificial intelligence have fallen this year, suggesting that investors are increasingly trying to separate the wheat from the chaff among companies claiming to be beneficiaries of the AI trend.

Massive share price rallies for high-profile groups such as Nvidia, the chip designer that this week became the world’s most valuable listed company, have spurred a growing debate about whether the US stock market is being driven by speculative hype.

But the recent declines for dozens of stocks that had benefited from the early enthusiasm suggest that investors are starting to look past optimistic commentary if the companies cannot back up their claims.

“AI is still a big theme but if you can’t demonstrate evidence you’re getting hurt,” said Stuart Kaiser, head of US equity trading strategy at Citi. “Just saying ‘AI’ 15 times is not going to cut it any more.”

About 60 per cent of stocks in the S&P 500 have risen this year, but more than half the stocks included in Citi’s “AI Winners Basket” — an index based on the names that were garnering the most excitement among the bank’s clients last year — have declined. More than three-quarters of companies in the AI basket had climbed in 2023.

Investment funds that tried to pick a wide spread of AI beneficiaries have had a similar experience. More than half of the individual stocks in BlackRock’s Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF, Invesco’s AI and Next Gen Software fund, and First Trust and Nasdaq’s Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF have declined this year.

Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, said: “Investors are looking a bit more at the earnings story among ‘AI’ names. The differentiator with something like a Nvidia is they have delivered on the bottom line, showing real data.”

Nvidia has more than doubled in value this year, after more than tripling in 2023, and its market cap is now well over $3tn. However, the massive demand for its graphics processing units is such that, measured as a multiple of its sales over the previous 12 months, the stock is actually cheaper than this time last year. 

In contrast, tech groups such as Salesforce, Snowflake, Intel and Adobe — now far smaller than Nvidia by market value, but classed as large-cap stocks — have fallen sharply after strong gains in 2023.

“In tech the bar was quite high [in earnings season] and if you missed that bar you got hit hard,” said Citi’s Kaiser. Salesforce suffered its worst one-day drop in 20 years after publishing a disappointing quarterly update last month.

Although some have taken the shift as a sign of rationality returning, Rob Arnott, chair of asset manager Research Affiliates, said the AI-linked rally still “has the look to me of a classic bubble”.

“One of the things about a classic bubble is you do see smaller players fade before big ones start to suffer,” he said.

Arnott stressed that he was a believer in the long-term impact of AI, but said “a lot of the benefits are going to come gradually, and the market is pricing in immediacy”."
"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, January 11, 2022"," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, January 11, 2022**

After one of the wildest days I’ve experienced in the market, stocks carried on yesterday’s momentum, with all three major indexes advancing as market participants digested new testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

**Markets Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): +0.91%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.52%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.50%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.05%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.05%
* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): +4.02%
* Sea Limited (SE): +6.01%
* Albertsons (ACI): -9.56%
* Virgin Orbit (VORB): +27.83%
* Shake Shack (SHAK): +12.14%
* Amazon (AMZN): +2.40%

During his confirmation hearing before Congress, Powell said the US economy was healthy enough to support a reduction in the accommodative monetary policy that has propped up the markets for the last two years. This means putting an end to quantitative easing and raising the interest rate.

He said, “As we move through this year … if things develop as expected, we’ll be normalizing policy, meaning we’re going to end our asset purchases in March, meaning we’ll be raising rates over the course of the year. At some point perhaps later this year we will start to allow the balance sheet to run off, and that’s just the road to normalizing policy.”

Powell reiterated that the Central Bank was prepared to act if the pace of inflation does not begin to moderate in the coming months. He said, “If we see inflation persisting at high levels, longer than expected, if we have to raise interest rates more over time, then we will.”

Powell said the moves are in response to an economy with a strong labor market, with an unemployment rate of 3.9% in December, but elevated inflation. Powell said, “What that \[the unemployment rate coupled with elevated inflation\] is really telling us is that the economy no longer needs or wants the very highly accommodative policies that we’ve had in place to deal with the pandemic and its aftermath. We’re really just going to be moving over the course of this year to a policy that is closer to normal. But it’s a long road to normal from where we are.”

The Fed’s most potent tool remains interest rates, which the central bank has pinned to zero since the depths of the pandemic. Raising interest rates could address higher demand by making it more expensive to borrow. However, higher borrowing costs would not do much to address supply-side constraints and shipping bottlenecks that are greatly contributing to the rise in prices. Powell said, “We can affect the demand side, we can’t affect the supply side. But this really is a combination of the two.”

Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield, which reached a yearly higher at 1.8% yesterday, came down after Powell’s speech, hovering at 1.741% at the time of writing. 

Steven Wieting, Global Chief Investment Strategist at Citigroup, said “We’re seeing across the board a re-rating of what the Federal Reserve will do. The likelihood is very clear that the Fed will succeed in sinking inflation. That is going to happen one way or the other and we are just trying to gather how actively the Fed will be doing that.”

Regarding interest rate hikes, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he sees the Fed passing four rate hikes next year, one more than the currently telegraphed three. Speaking to CNBC, Dimon said, ""It's possible that inflation is worse than people think. I, personally, would be surprised if it's just four increases this year. Four would be very easy for the economy to absorb.""

Looking ahead, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release December’s Consumer Price Index Friday, which is currently expected to show a 7.0% jump in year-over-year prices, the largest jump since 1982. This could also spark more volatility. 

Moreover, at the end of the week, big financial institutions, including JP Morgan (JPM), Blackrock (BLK), Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) will earnings Friday morning before the opening bell.

**Highlights**

* Intel (INTC) analysts gave a nod of approval to the chipmaker on its move to recruit Micron’s (MU) David Zinsner to serve as Chief Financial Officer as part of a broader shakeup by CEO Pat Gelsinger.

Intel board member quit after differences over chipmaker's revival plan,"The sudden resignation of a high-profile Intel board member came after differences with CEO Pat Gelsinger and other directors over what the director considered the U.S. company's bloated workforce, risk-averse culture and lagging artificial intelligence strategy, according to three sources familiar with the matter.

Lip-Bu Tan, a semiconductor industry veteran, had said he was leaving the board because of a personal decision to ""reprioritize various commitments"" and that he remained ""supportive of the company and its important work,"" in a regulatory filing on Thursday.

The former CEO of chip-software company Cadence Design joined Intel's board two years ago as part of a plan to restore Intel's place as the leading global chipmaker. The board expanded Tan's responsibilities in October 2023, authorizing him to oversee manufacturing operations.

Over time, Tan grew frustrated by the company's large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intel's risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly. 

The circumstances around Tan's exit have not previously been reported. The departure of the industry veteran, who is well-regarded by investors, over Intel's strategy illustrates the uncertainty of its turnaround efforts.

Tan leaves as the company endures one of the bleakest periods in its five-decade history that has left it vulnerable to a potential activist shareholder attack, former executives said. Intel has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to prepare a defense, according to sources familiar with the matter, confirming an earlier report.

Intel, headquartered in California, declined to comment. Tan's venture capital firm, Walden Catalyst, did not respond to a request for comment.

Tan's exit leaves a vacuum of chip-industry technical and business acumen on the board, which is populated by leaders in academia and finance, and former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries, say investors and semiconductor industry insiders.

Former Intel executives told Reuters the company began preparing for a potential activist threat months ago. Reuters could not independently confirm if any shareholders were preparing an approach.

This month, Intel paused its dividend that it had been paying for decades when it reported results and plans to reduce capital spending on factory construction. The next day, investors wiped more than $30 billion from its market value, or more than a quarter of its worth.

Intel's struggles are occurring against the backdrop of aggressive investment and sales from rivals swept up by the surge of interest in artificial intelligence. The AI boom turned graphics chipmaker Nvidia into a $3-trillion market-cap company. Intel passed on an opportunity in 2018 to take as much as a 30% stake in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Reuters previously reported.

Intel acquired at least two AI startups, among more than four efforts since 2010 to build a blockbuster AI chip, according to former executives. Even though its Habana acquisition yielded promising AI chips, its senior leaders left to form a rival effort in Israel, hurting Intel's program, two sources said.

To cut costs, Intel announced in August layoffs of more than 15% of its workforce, its second round of cuts in two years. Intel had nearly 125,300 employees globally according to its August financial results.

The layoff plan was one source of tension between Tan and the board, according to sources. Tan wanted specific cuts, including middle managers who do not contribute to Intel's engineering efforts.

Gelsinger, who took over in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan, added at least 20,000 employees to Intel's payroll by 2022.

To Tan and some former Intel executives, the workforce appeared bloated. Teams on some projects were as much as five times larger than others doing comparable work at rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices, according to two sources. One former executive said Intel should have cut double the number it announced in August years ago.

Tan has told people he believed Intel was overrun by bureaucratic layers of middle managers who impeded progress at Intel's server and desktop chips divisions and the cuts should have focused on these people.

Intel's workforce, which is larger than those of Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co combined, has led to a complacent and uncompetitive culture, far from the ""only-the-paranoid-survive"" ethos of Intel co-founder Andy Grove, former Intel executives said.

Intel's turnaround plan relies on building its foundry business, which helps other companies manufacture chips, similar to TSMC. But the company has not disclosed a big customer and has said the business is not expected to turn a profit until 2027.

An attempt last year to break into contract-manufacturing through a $5.4-billion purchase of Israel-based chip manufacturer Tower Semiconductor was scuttled after China blocked the deal. Intel would have obtained an organization dedicated to contract chipmaking, something Intel has never done successfully.

Without Tower, Intel, historically a maker of its own chips, lacks the expertise to work with external customers, which it has struggled to attract, according to four sources familiar with Intel's manufacturing business.

Tan grew frustrated as the board did not follow his recommendations over how to make the manufacturing business more customer-centric and to remove unnecessary bureaucracy, a person close to Tan said.

Intel has continued to build new factories in Ohio, Arizona and across Europe without naming new customers.

How to get over selling stocks that rocketed later (e.g. NVDA)?,"Got into investing a few years ago (2021?) and bought 100 NVDA shares around an average of $230. Held it through the crash down to $120 or so, then it recovered to $400 which I thought was nuts and with all the articles about it being overhyped I sold my entire holding (I know it's dumb) as I'd almost doubled my value. By now it would have been triple even that. I don't think I really have the mindset for investing in general but how do I move on from missing out on up to 70k USD in gains? :(

TSMC beats first-quarter revenue and profit expectations on strong AI chip demand ,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday beat revenue and profit expectations in the first quarter, thanks to continued strong demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications.

Here are TSMC’s first-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Net revenue: 592.64 billion New Taiwan dollars ($18.87 billion), vs. NT$582.94 billion expected

Net income: NT$225.49 billion, vs. NT$213.59 billion expected

TSMC reported net revenue rose 16.5% from a year ago to NT$592.64 billion, while net income increased 8.9% from a year ago to NT$225.49 billion. The firm guided first-quarter revenue to be between $18 billion and $18.8 billion.

TSMC is the world’s largest producer of advanced processors and counts companies such as Nvidia and Apple as its clients.

“For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our business to be supported by strong demand for industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by a continued smartphone seasonality,” CFO Wendell Huang said during the firm’s earnings call Thursday.

CEO C.C. Wei said TSMC expects 2024 to be a “healthy” growth year, supported by “our technology leadership and broader customer base.”

“Almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address an insatiable AI-related demand for energy efficient computing power,” said Wei, adding that the firm estimates revenue contribution from server AI processors to “more than double this year.”

TSMC expects second-quarter revenue to be between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion.

TSMC currently produces 3-nanometer chips and plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Typically, a smaller nanometer size yields more powerful and efficient chips. 

Strong demand for AI chips led by the proliferation of large language models such as ChatGPT and Chinese clones has caused TSMC’s shares to surge 56% in the past one year.

“TSMC is well-positioned for strong performance based on key industry trends. The continued demand for advanced chips, particularly those used in AI applications, is a positive sign for both the short and long term. The focus on advanced chip development, like the shift towards 3nm technology, is another factor driving long-term growth for TSMC,” Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research, said on Monday ahead of the results.

TSMC accounted for 61% of global foundry revenue in the fourth quarter, according to Counterpoint Research data. Samsung Foundry came in second with 14% of the market.

“TSMC’s net profit margin continues to be one of the highest in the company’s history at 40%, against an industry average of 14%, demonstrating TSMC’s strong competitive position. The high margin is the result of an increased share of sales of 7nm and smaller chips, which have significantly higher margins,” Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at Conotoxia, said last week.

Last year, TSMC’s business was impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and inventory adjustment. Smartphone and PC makers stockpiled chips during the pandemic, leading to surplus inventories as Covid-era demand waned.

Earlier this month, Taiwan was hit by an earthquake – its strongest one in 25 years. A TSMC spokesperson said its construction sites were normal upon initial inspection, though workers from some fabs were briefly evacuated. Those workers subsequently returned to their workplaces.

“There were no power shortages, no structural damage to our fabs and there is no damage to our critical tools, including all of our extreme ultraviolet lithography tools,” CFO Huang told investors and analysts on Thursday.

EUV machines are critical in the production of the most advanced processors.

However, some wafers were affected and “had to be scrapped,” said Huang, adding that the firm expects most of the lost production to be recovered in second quarter, with “minimal impact” to revenue.

The U.S. also recently granted TSMC’s Arizona subsidiary preliminary approval for government funding worth up to $6.6 billion to build the world’s most advanced semiconductors. TSMC is also eligible for about $5 billion in proposed loans.

Should I cash out on Nvidia?,"I bought a lot of nvidia several year ago and currently have over a thousand shares. My portfolio has multiplied In value several times. Seeing how nvidia is near its all time high, I’m wondering if now should be the time I cash out and run. I’m worried about the possibility of a recession and stock market tanking within the next 6 or so months. Anyone else have nvidia and did you cash out? It’s a big choice to make and would like a little input. Thank you."
"If you could only own 2 tech stocks for next 5 years, who do you believe in most and why","I admit I stink at picking tech companies, I don't understand how to value them properly and I get out way to early.  Example, bought Nvda and uber, both at the market bottom 2 octobers ago, got out of nvda after first 100 up, uber in high 20's sold in 50's.....someone please hand me my dunce cap.  Both buys where just cause I felt like they got beat up to much and both sales were because I thought they went to far to fast.  Currently I have intel and evgo, intc is a small winner and evgo is a big fat loser,  tech is a massive whole in my portfolio"
AMD shares fall as first-quarter forecast comes in light,"Here’s how the company did versus LESG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus estimates for the quarter ended in December:

EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected

Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected


For the first quarter, AMD said it expects about $5.4 billion in sales, plus or minus $300 million, while analysts were looking for revenue of $5.73 billion. AMD added that it expected all of its major businesses, including server and PC chips, to decline sequentially during the quarter.

Net income in the fourth quarter was $667 million, or $0.41 per share, versus $21 million, or $0.01 per share a year ago.

AMD makes graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are needed to train and deploy generative artificial intelligence models. While that market is currently dominated by Nvidia, AMD has said that its new AI chips introduced last year will challenge Nvidia’s H100 GPUs for some applications, and investors are looking for significant growth in the company’s data center segment over the next few years.

In October, AMD said it expected $2 billion in server GPU sales in 2024.

But historically, AMD’s main business has been central processors, or CPUs, for PCs and servers. Compared to AI chips, that part of the semiconductor industry has been flat or shrinking over the past few years, as PC sales have suffered post-pandemic.

Data center, which includes server CPUs and AI chips, rose 38% on an annual basis to $2.28 billion in sales. It’s now firmly AMD’s largest business and the company said that much of the increase in revenue was attributable to “strong growth” for sales of its Instinct graphics processors, which are used for AI.

However, AMD’s overall performance in the business was in line with a $2.29 billion FactSet estimates for the Data Center business.

AMD’s client group, which is comprised mostly of chips for PCs and laptops, rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.

Sales in AMD’s gaming segment, which includes “semi-custom” processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a “significant” double-digit percentage in the current quarter.

AMD’s embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.

# **Stocks are ignoring the lack of a stimulus package from Congress, but that could change  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/stocks-are-ignoring-the-lack-of-a-stimulus-package-from-congress-but-that-could-change.html)**
*****
> Stocks could hang at record levels but gains may be capped until Congress agrees to a new stimulus package to help the economy and the millions of unemployed Americans.
*****
> Stocks were higher in the past week, and the S&P 500 flirted with record levels it set in February.
*****
> In the coming week, there are some major retailers reporting earnings, including Walmart, Home Depot and Target, but the season is mostly over and the market is entering a quiet period. There are minutes from the Fed’s last meeting, released Wednesday, and housing data, including starts Tuesday and existing sales Friday.
*****
> Investors had been watching efforts by Congress to agree to a new stimulus package, but talks have failed and the Senate has gone on recess. There is a concern that Congress will not be convinced to provide a big enough package when it does get to work again on the next stimulus round because recent economic reports look stronger. July’s retail sales, for example, climbed to a record level and recovered to pre-pandemic levels.
*****
> “The juxtaposition of getting more fiscal stimulus and better data has paralyzed us in our tracks … we’ve seen this sideways [market] action,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Alliance. “It feels like we need more action from Congress, and the concern is the longer we wait, the better the data gets and the less impactful the next round of stimulus will be.”
*****
> Some technical analysts say the market may pull back around the high, to allow it to consolidate gains before moving higher into the end of the year. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high of 3,393 on Feb. 19.
*****
> Hogan said he expects stocks to tread sideways during the dog days of August, but they could begin to react negatively to the election in September. He also said it is important that progress continue against the spread of Covid-19, as the economy continues to reopen.
*****
> Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the market could have a wakeup call at some point that the stimulus package has not been approved.
*****
> “I think it will cross over a line where they care,” he said. “I think the market is in suspended animation of believing there will be a magical deal.” Boockvar said he expects a deal ultimately, but the impact is not likely to be as big as the last round of funding.
*****
> “What they’re not grasping is any deal, any extension of unemployment benefits, is going to be smaller than it was, and the rate of change should be the most important thing investors focus on,” he said. “Not the binary outcome of whether there’s a deal or no deal. There’s going to be less air going into the balloon.”
*****
> # It’s the economy
> Still, economists expect to see a strong rebound in the third quarter, and are anticipating about about a 20% jump in third-quarter growth. But they also say that could be threatened if Congress does not help with another stimulus package.
*****
> Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, described the July retail sales as a perfect V-shaped recovery, but cautioned it would not last unless more aid gets to individuals and cities and states. Democrats have sought a $3 trillion spending package, and Republicans in the Senate offered a $1 trillion package. They could not reach a compromise, including on a $600 weekly payment to individuals on unemployment which expired July 31.
*****
> President Donald Trump has tried to fill the gap with executive orders to provide extra benefits to those on unemployment, but the $300 federal payment and $100 from states may take some time to reach individuals, as the processing varies by state. He has also issued an order instructing the Treasury to temporarily defer collection of payroll taxes from individuals making up to $104,000.
*****
> “I think in August and September, there will be a lot of Ws, if there’s not more help here,” said Zandi, referring to an economic recovery that retrenches from a V shape before heading higher again. “It’s clearly perplexing. It may take the stock market to say we’re not going to get what we expect, and sell off and light a fire.”
*****
> Zandi said it could come to a situation like 2008, where the stock market sold off sharply before Congress would agree to a program that helped financial companies.
*****
> “We need a TARP moment to get these guys to help. Maybe if the claims tick higher and the August employment numbers are soft, given the president is focused on the stock market, that might be what it takes to get them back to the table in earnest,” he said, referring to the Troubled Asset Relief Program that helped rescue banks during the financial crisis.
*****
> He ultimately expects a package of about $1.5 trillion to be approved in September.
*****
> The lack of funding for state and local governments could result in more layoffs, as they struggle with their current 2021 budgets, Zandi said. Already 1.3 million public sector jobs have been lost since February, and there will be more layoffs and more programs and projects cancelled. The impact will hit contractors and other businesses that provide services to local governments.
*****
> “The multipliers on state and local government are among the highest of any form of support, so if you don’t provide it, it’s going to ripple through the economy pretty fast,” he said.
*****
> Economists expect to see a softening in consumer spending in August with the more than 28 million Americans on unemployment benefits as of mid-July no longer receiving any supplemental pay.
*****
> “The real irony is things are shaping up that September is going to be a bad month, and that’s going to show up in all the data in October,” Zandi said. “They are really taking a chance on this election by not acting.”

> # 4 Charts That Will Amaze You

> The S&P 500 Index is a few points away from a new all-time high, completing one of the fastest recoveries from a bear market ever. But this will also seal the deal on the shortest bear market ever. Remember, the S&P 500 Index lost 20% from an all-time high in only 16 trading days back in February and March, so it makes sense that this recovery could be one of the fastest ever.

> From the lows on March 23, the S&P 500 has now added more than 50%. Many have been calling this a bear market rally for months, while we have been in the camp this is something more. It’s easy to see why this rally is different based on where it stands versus other bear market rallies:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> They say the stock market is the only place where things go on sale, yet everyone runs out of the store screaming. We absolutely saw that back in March and now with stocks near new highs, many have missed this record run. Here we show how stocks have been usually higher a year or two after corrections.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> After a historic drop in March, the S&P 500 has closed higher in April, May, June, and July. This rare event has happened only 11 other times, with stocks gaining the final five months of the year a very impressive 10 times. Only 2018 and the nearly 20% collapse in December saw a loss those final five months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GS-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this bear market will go down as the fastest ever, at just over one month. The recovery back to new highs will be five months if we get there by August 23, making this one of the fastest recoveries ever. Not surprisingly, it usually takes longer for bear markets in a recession to recover; only adding to the impressiveness of this rally.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.12.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> “It normally takes 30 months for bear markets during a recession to recover their losses, which makes this recovery all the more amazing,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strateigst Ryan Detrick.. “Then again, there has been nothing normal about this recession, so maybe we shouldn’t be shocked about yet another record going down in 2020.”

> # When a Few Basis Points Packs a Punch

> US Treasury yields have been on the rise this week with the 10-year yield rising 13 basis points (bps) from 0.56% up to 0.69% after getting as high as 0.72% on Thursday. A 13 bps move higher in interest rates may not seem like a whole lot, but with rates already at such low levels, a small move can have a pretty big impact on the prices of longer-term maturities.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-10-Year-Yield.png))**

> Starting with longer-term US Treasuries, TLT, which measures the performance of maturities greater than 20 years, has declined 3.5% this week. Now, for a growth stock, 3.5% is par for the course, but that kind of move in the Treasury market is no small thing. The latest pullback for TLT also coincides with another failed attempt by the ETF to trade and stay above $170 for more than a day.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-TLT.png))**

> The further out the maturity window you go in the fixed income market, the bigger the impact of the move higher in interest rates. The Republic of Austria issued a 100-year bond in 2017, and its movements exemplify the wild moves that small changes in interest rates (from a low base) can have on prices. Just this week, the Austrian 100-year was down over 5%, which is a painful move no matter what type of asset class you are talking about. This week's move, though, was nothing compared to the stomach-churning swings from earlier this year. When Covid was first hitting the fan, the 100-year rallied 57% in the span of less than two months. That kind of move usually occurs over years rather than days, but in less than a third of that time, all those gains disintegrated in a two-and-a-half week span from early to late March. Easy come, easy go. Ironically enough, despite all the big up and down moves in this bond over the last year, as we type this, the bond's price is the same now as it was on this same day last year.

> # Retail Sales Rock to New Highs

> At the headline level, July’s Retail Sales report disappointed as the reading missed expectations by nearly a full percentage point. Just as soon as the report was released, we saw a number of stories pounce on the disappointment as a sign that the economy was losing steam. Looked at in more detail, though, the July report wasn’t all that bad. While the headline reading rose less than expected (1.2% vs 2.1%), Ex Autos and Ex Autos and Gas, the results were much better than expected. Not only that, but June’s original readings were all revised higher by around a full percentage point.

> Besides the fact that this month’s report was better underneath the surface and June’s reading was revised higher, it was also notable as the seasonally-adjusted annualized rate of sales in July hit a new record high. After the last record high back in January, only five months passed until American consumers were back to their pre-Covid spending ways. For the sake of comparison, back during the Financial Crisis, 40 months passed between the original high in Retail Sales in November 2007 and the next record high in April 2011. 5 months versus 40? Never underestimate the power of the US consumer!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/081420-retail-sales-chart1.png))**

> While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just released B.I.G. Tips report we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

> # 100 Days of Gains

> Today marked 100 trading days since the Nasdaq 100's March 20th COVID Crash closing low. Below is a chart showing the rolling 100-trading day percentage change of the Nasdaq 100 since 1985. The 59.8% gain over the last 100 trading days ranks as the 3rd strongest run on record. The only two stronger 100-day rallies ended in January 1999 and March 2000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/ndx100use.png))**

> While the Nasdaq 100 bottomed on Friday, March 20th, the S&P 500 bottomed the following Monday (3/23). This means tomorrow will mark 100 trading days since the S&P 500's COVID Crash closing low. Right now the rolling 100-day percentage change for the S&P 500 sits at +46.7%. But if the S&P manages to trade at current levels tomorrow, the 100-day gain will jump above 50%. It has been 87 years (1933) since we've seen a 100-day gain of more than 50%!

> # B.I.G. Tips - New Highs In Sight

> Whether you want to look at it from the perspective of closing prices or intraday levels, the S&P 500 is doing what just about everybody thought would be impossible less than five months ago - approaching record highs. Relative to its closing high of 3,386.15, the S&P 500 is just 0.27% lower, while it's within half of a percent from its record intraday high of 3,393.52. Through today, the S&P 500 has gone 120 trading days without a record high, and as shown in the chart below, the current streak is barely even visible when viewed in the perspective of all streaks since 1928. Even if we zoom in on just the last five years, the current streak of 120 trading days only ranks as the fourth-longest streak without a new high.

> While the S&P 500's 120-trading day streak without a new high isn't extreme by historical standards, the turnaround off the lows has been extraordinary. In the S&P 500's history, there have been ten prior declines of at least 20% from a record closing high. Of those ten prior periods, the shortest gap between the original record high and the next one was 309 trading days, and the shortest gap between highs that had a pullback of at least 30% was 484 tradings days (or more than four times the current gap of 120 trading days). For all ten streaks without a record high, the median drought was 680 trading days.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/Streaks-Chart.png))**

> Whenever the S&P 500 does take out its 2/19 high, the question is whether the new high represents a breakout where the S&P 500 keeps rallying into evergreen territory, or does it run out of gas after finally reaching a new milestone? To shed some light on this question, we looked at the S&P 500's performance following each prior streak of similar duration without a new high.

"Arm prices IPO at $51 per share, valuing company at over $54 billion","https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/09/13/arm-prices-ipo-at-51-per-share.html

-Chip design company Arm priced its long-awaited initial public offering on Wednesday.
-Masayoshi Son's SoftBank will own about 90% of the company after the offering.
-Arm customers, including Apple, Google, Nvidia and Samsung, have said they will buy shares in the IPO.


Who’s betting it will be up to $200 by Friday and go down to $70 by Tuesday?  
Then after a week or two no one will care."

Shares of Micron pop 14% on earnings beat driven by AI boom,"Shares of Micron popped more than 14% in extended trading on Wednesday after the company announced second-quarter fiscal 2024 results that beat analysts and offered rosy guidance. The company, which makes memory and storage for computers, said it has benefitted from the artificial intelligence boom.

Here’s how the company did:

Earnings per share: 42 cents adjusted vs. 25 cent loss expected by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.

Revenue: $5.82 billion vs. 5.35 billion expected by LSEG.

Micron said revenue rose to $5.82 billion from $3.69 billion in the year ago quarter. The company reported a net income of $793 million, up from a net loss of $2.3 billion in the same period last year.

For its fiscal third quarter, Micron expects to report revenue of $6.6 billion, above the $6.02 billion expected by analysts.

“We believe Micron is one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multi-year opportunity enabled by AI,” Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a release.

Micron has long provided memory and flash storage for computers, data centers and phones. Large data centers are used to power the influx of new AI software. While Nvidia has grabbed much of the spotlight for its graphics processing units that run AI, companies like Micron benefit by providing the memory and storage for those systems.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren writes a letter backing the DOJ investigation into Nvidia antitrust allegations,"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-backs-justice-department-nvidia-antitrust-investigation-2024-9

September 5 2024

Dear Assistant Attorney General Kanter.

Competition is key to a thriving U.S. economy and faster economic growth. This is particularly true in the semiconductor market, which will drive future advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and other tech breakthroughs --- the reason Congress provided $52.7 billion in support for the industry in the CHIPS and Science Act.

This is why I welcome the reports that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened an antitrust investigation into Nvidia, whose blockbuster growth has made it one of the world's largest companies. While this growth has been primarily driven by the recent AI boom, it has been supercharged by Nvidia's use of anticompetitive tactics that have choked off competition and chilled innovation. I am pleased that the DOJ has joined authorities in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the European Union, in investigating Nvidia's conduct.

Until recently, Nvidia was a relatively niche provider of gaming chips, but as a ""prime beneficiary of the Al frenzy,"" it has seen its market capitalization increase by 250% between November 2021 and May 2024. The money involved is vast, and Big Tech is spending most of it: Microsoft and Meta spent a combined $9 billion on Nvidia's chips last year alone. Amazon purchased as many as 50,000 chips in 2023. And Google plans to pour nearly $40 billion into AI this year much of it on Nvidia's products and services.

As a result of this spending, Nvidia now controls an estimated 90% of the market for high-end AI chips and 98% of the lucrative and growing data center graphics processing units (GPUS) market. Its hardware has been the underpinning of almost every AI milestone, including the development and deployment of OpenAl's ChatGPT-4 and other models. Market power like that means the company decides who gets chips from its limited supply and how much they pay, with some experts theorizing that Nvidia has been making a 1000% profit through the retail price of some of its chips. This has effectively made Nvidia the gatekeeper for the world's AI future. 

But in carrying out this responsibility, Nvidia has shown that it is not committed to fair play. The company locks customers in by bundling products, software, and services a practice that has already triggered antitrust scrutiny in France-resulting in Nvidia's own programming software being the only system that is fully compatible with its chips. In a move that was ultimately blocked by the Federal Trade Commission, Nvidia has attempted to further raise barriers to entry by acquiring Arm Limited, the developer of essential chip architecture. If the deal had gone through, experts say Nvidia would have gained control over a software architecture that most of the industry relies on. As Nvidia cements its dominance, venture funders are investing less in companies attempting to build competing chips. Indeed, the number of U.S. venture funding deals for Al chips fell approximately 80% between 2022 and 2023.

The insatiable hunger of gargantuan Big Tech companies for Nvidia chips, along with the company's opaque and preferential allocation of them, are starving startup companies of the infrastructure they need to do business and crowding academic AI researchers out of the field. Allowing a single company so much influence over AI research, development, and monetization poses dire economic risks. Competition powers a virtuous cycle of rapid innovation by impelling each market participant to create the best products. It creates jobs and generates tax revenue. It reduces the need for regulation by giving the market a role in keeping aspiring monopolists in check. It reduces costs for companies by giving them a choice of suppliers.

Without the intervention of U.S. regulators, the prospects of restoring competition in the semiconductor market are bleak. They will only grow bleaker as Nvidia approaches 100% ownership of the market, and as it begins pouring money into lobbying alongside the conventional Big Tech players to shape the contours of AI regulation and lock in its advantage. I thank you for your leadership and support efforts to undertake a comprehensive and fair investigation into Nvidia.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Warren 
United States Senator

How hard is it for big tech or anyone to compete with Nvidia in the next ten years?,"I see what amazon eventually did to UPS and I wonder if they don't push as hard as they can to cut Nvidia out?

Is it really that impossible?

Or is time the magic ingredient that gives nvidia it's moat?

So the other companies will always play catch up.

But, on the other hand can Nvidia keep providing new things that are required or is there a point where innovation kinda stops for a while and other companies catch up.

I wonder if nvidia is really a good long term investment especially at this price point.

Or if competition is going to be a big thing."

Nvidia to Slow Hiring Amid Inflationary Environment,"Nvidia is slowing the pace of hiring, the company confirmed on Sunday.

The chip maker joins several other major technology companies that have decided to be more prudent with their operating budgets in recent weeks.

On Friday, The New Indian Express reported the semiconductor company’s management has told its hiring managers to pare down hiring of new recruits.

“We’ve been extremely successful in hiring this year,” a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement to Barron’s when asked for comment on the report. “We’re slowing for now to integrate these new employees and to focus our budget on taking care of existing employees as inflation persists.”

The technology industry has been cutting back as it struggles to deal with rising inflation and a deteriorating global economic environment.

"Nvidia falls short on guidance, stock down 9% after hours","Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA?p=NVDA&.tsrc=fin-srch)) reported its Q1 earnings after the bell Wednesday beating analysts' expectations on revenue and earnings per share, but falling short on Q2 estimates.

Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what Wall Street was expecting from the graphics card giant in the quarter.

· **Revenue:** $8.29 billion versus $8.10 billion expected

· **Adjusted EPS:** $1.36 versus $1.30 expected

· **Data Center:** $3.75 billion versus $3.63 billion expected

· **Gaming:** $3.62 billion versus $3.53 billion expected

Nvidia, however, missed on its Q2 revenue expectations. The company says it will see $8.1 billion in the upcoming quarter, while Wall Street was expecting $8.44 billion. Nvidia says it will miss out on some $500 million in revenue in the quarter due to the war in Ukraine and the impact of COVID lockdowns in China.

Shares of Nvidia were down more than 9%.

Nvidia’s earnings come as tech stocks have been especially pounded amid a broader market selloff. Nvidia shares are off more than 28% over the last three months, while shares of rival AMD ([AMD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD?p=AMD&.tsrc=fin-srch)) are off more than 20%.

Shares of Qualcomm ([QCOM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCOM?p=QCOM&.tsrc=fin-srch)) have also suffered, falling 22%. Intel ([INTC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC?p=INTC&.tsrc=fin-srch)), meanwhile, has managed to stay roughly in line with the S&P 500, with shares dropping more than 9% compared to the index’s 7% decline.

Crucially for Nvidia, and gamers, graphics cards are finally returning to store shelves after months of crushing supply chain disruptions. That’s not to say the chip shortage is over, not by a long shot.

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger predicts that the [shortage will continue into 2024](https://news.yahoo.com/intel-ceo-expects-semiconductor-shortage-152837733.html), which means we’re still far from returning to pre-pandemic availability for many semiconductors.

That said, Nvidia’s cards, along with AMD’s, are dropping in price thanks to the crash in cryptocurrency prices. A decrease in the price of crypto usually coincides with a drop in card prices as miners turn their attention away from buying up available supplies to mine coins.

Nvidia is also expected to unveil its latest graphics card lineup in the coming months. Dubbed the RTX 4000-series, the cards should provide a welcome performance boost over the company’s current RTX 3000-series line, not to mention boost Nvidia’s bottom line.

Metaverse: Next Biggest Opportunity,"  

It was the internet in the late ’90s, social media in the 2000s, and digital currency (crypto) in the 2010s. Facebook’s Metaverse might be one of the greatest investment opportunities in the 2020s. If you are following Facebook’s Connect 2021 conference you will realize how much deep Facebook now Meta has invested in the platform. They own Oculus which is the first step towards VR/AR metaverse. The application of Metaverse based platforms is immense and beyond gaming and virtually every aspect of our lives. Here are some of the potential companies to benefit from:

1. Unity Software: Virtually all applications will be developed either on Unity or Unreal Engine.

2. Autodesk: They own 3D Max and Maya which again might be used to develop VR/AR applications. Plus they have various Building Information Modelling tools like Revit and Navisworks which might be useful in creating Metaverse beyond gaming.

3. Matterport: 3D scanning 

4. Trimble: Again they have Sketchup and various 3D scanning tools

5. Shopify and Amazon: They might be the first ones to create virtual stores.

6. Microsoft: They own Minecraft and have developed ‘Hololens’

7. Roblox: The platform already works with Oculus.

Let me know if there are any other key players which I have missed.

Apple’s Stock Price Reaches All-Time High After WWDC Announcements ,"“Apple's stock price has crossed the $200 mark and reached a new all-time high in intraday trading, one day after the company unveiled its Apple Intelligence suite of AI features coming with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.

Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple to become the world's second most valuable company last week, amid strong demand for its AI server chips, but Apple has now regained second place with a $3.1 trillion market cap as of writing. Apple now trails only Microsoft, which has a nearly $3.2 trillion market cap as of writing.”

Pretty impressive rally by Apple. I think they have presented one of the more marketable and useful presentations regarding how their AI features will help everyday users. Also Apple Intelligence is an elite name.

This doesn't feel sustainable for a nearly $1 TRILLION Company!,"tl;dr at bottom  
Not trying to start a debate, I'm not long or short $NVDA, don't own any, and I don't plan to open a position anytime soon, I'm just your monthly buyer of $VOO and $QQQ.  

However, to the bulls out there, what is the reason for such a MASSIVE premium for this stock?  I understand they crushed earnings and increased foecast to a nearly 50% gain in revenue by Q1 2024, but even with that premium, they are trading at a nearly 200 P/E.  

Assuming NVDA maintains that 50% premium and holds it for all 4-quarters in 2024, thats $44B in revenue which if they had 100% margins and zero cost of any kind, it would take you almost 22 years to payback the value of the stock. 

Sure, someone will tell me P/Es don't matter, and they are growing like crazy, but at what point is the value of the stock (again, almost $1 TRILLION) still out of control? 

\- Their Gross Profit is 56% which is impressive, but not unherd of (MSFT is 68%, META is 80%)   
\- Their net income is 16% which is right in line with everyones favoriate not a car company TESLA at 15%

Lets throw out fundamentals since they clearly don't matter that much for this stock and look at their growth:  $7.19B (lower than Q1 2022 of $8.29B).  

Their Q4 22 Revenue was $6.05B vs. Q4 21 of $7.64B

So grow is slower/stagnant from the previsous years, so why does that get such a massive premium?  Did they beat earnings estimates, yes, but those were concervitive.  Did they raise guidance by 50% due to the AI boom, yeah, how long will that last?  Same length as the gaming/crypto/at home boom?  Okay, then what, revenue falls again? 

  
TL;dr  
People talk about $TSLA being over valued, I've never seen a stock like $NVDA before being this ""overvalued"" in my life. What is keeping it up?"

Shareholders Approve NVIDIA Stock Split,"Shareholders finally approve NVIDIA stock split. The stock split will be payable in the form of a stock dividend. Each shareholder of record as of June 21 will receive an additional three shares of stock for every share held. The shares will be distributed after the market close on July 19, and the newly split shares will begin trading when the market opens on Tuesday, July 20. 

Existing shareholders won't have to do anything to receive the additional shares, which will be deposited directly into their brokerage accounts once the stock split takes effect. It's important to note that investors shouldn't necessarily expect the new shares to appear in their account immediately after the market close on July 19. As internal processes differ from brokerage to brokerage, it may take as many as several days for the new shares to show up in investor accounts.

Finally, investors should remember that a stock split does nothing to change the value of the underlying business, but merely divides it into a great number of ownership portions. As an example, NVIDIA shares have lately been trading for roughly $700. This means instead of having one share worth $700, shareholders would own four shares, each worth $175."
Nvidia Earnings: NVDA Stock Heads 6% Higher on Strong Q4 Results,"EPS : $1.89 vs $1.67 estimates  

Revenue : $3.11 billion vs $2.97 billion estimates  


Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is up 136.25% from the 80 cents during the fiscal fourth quarter for 2019.  

Revenue for the quarter climbs 40.72% higher from the $2.21 billion during the same period of the year prior.  

Operating income of $990 million is a 236.74% increase year-over-year from $294 million.
The Nvidia earnings report also contains a net income of $950 million.  

This is a 67.55% boost from the company’s net income of $567 million from the same time last year.

Why should anyone buy Nvidia when they can buy TSMC/Samsung/Intel and get the same AI upside with less risk?,"Nvidia, because of explosive demand for AI, is trading at over 100 times earnings. It is priced on the assumption of a distant future where there is a continued and growing demand for AI products, and where they face little competition.

The thing is, Nvidia's high gross margins are public knowledge. And they cannot produce enough chips. This gives fabs such as TSMC, Samsung, and possibly even Intel insane pricing power.

On top of all this, if a competitor happens to provide a viable alternative to Nvidia, it could put significant pressure on Nvidia's margins and market share, but the fabs could continue to charge high prices per wafer.

TSMC is trading at a P/E of 25 and Samsung 35, which is high, but not too high for a growing company.

There's a saying, ""During a gold rush, sell shovels"". A lot of people may say that Nvidia's AI chips are the shovels, but I'd argue the analogy leans more towards fabs like TSMC. A shovel still has some use after a gold rush ends, an AI chip has little use after an AI rush ends. But a fab always has chips to produce, whether they're AI chips, or other purposes."
Why are people so confident about upcoming NVDA August earnings?,"Can anyone explain why people are so bullish about $NVDA stock going up after the earnings report? I’m pretty sure the earnings report is going to exceed expectations, but that doesn’t mean the stock will go up. If everyone knows that Nvidia will beat the earnings, then it’s already priced in."
Massive Misconception About the Writers Strike,"What most people do not realize is that the majority of the major studies are owned by larger entities that do not suffer from this. Sure its small term pain knowing that certain projects are on hold. There is a lot of content in the coffers that they can still continue to produce without additional writing.

Most of the major studios also have other revenue streams that power them through. Let's just take Disney to start. They have $8.3B coming in from parks. They have $5.5B coming in from Streaming. They have 1.9 Billion coming in from cord deals.

Look at Comcast, they have Peacock streamers, they have their existing cable business, they have their internet business (mixed with cable subscribers), they have their mobile unit.. they have plenty to keep powering their way through.

Then you have weird companies like Apple and Amazon who can take virtual losses forever in entertainment and not care. Netflix is weird because of all its custom content but has a massive catalog of back content to keep subscribers happy for a while.

&#x200B;

What stocks to look at are the ones that rely only on content to stay alive. Those are the companies to be paying attention too. For instance I'd be very interested in how Warner Bro's/Discovery are going to be doing.  I'd also look at Sony who owes a lot to their entertainment divisions for profits (sure they do electronics and niche other areas), but they own some of the larger studios.

&#x200B;

I also don't want to make this a political topic but the Writers guild really needs to re-think their leverage. Sure the major studio's wont have new content coming out and already put a massive backlog and delays to projects. The major studios now are conglomerates that own so many other businesses they can keep moving along. They also don't realize that these studios will keep generating revenue but don't have to pay any of the writers, actors, production, etc... they have a freeze on money coming in but also a freeze on money going out.  The problem with industry consolidation + multi-faceted businesses is you lose your negotiating leverage.

&#x200B;

Would love to hear other peoples thoughts on this. What do you think?

&#x200B;

Especially their fear of AI As they know will becoming after their jobs. Netflix already was using it to determine what  shows and themes would be the most productive for returns. Disney/ILM started using it to replace opening credits. Disney even hired the group that for the end of Mando Season 2 were Luke showed up, another group of people showed they could do a better Deep Fake and they hired them. If I'm not mistaken Netflix used AI to write one of black mirrors episodes.

AI is coming and I can see why writers are so fearful. People are so naive on the idea that AI is coming for jobs even creative.

&#x200B;

If anything I'd love to hear from people some of the VFX studios if they are public? That would be were I would start putting money into. Ones that are progressive and have a massive catalogue. It sucks ILM is private (Disney owned), Pixar (Disney Owned), Dreamworks, etc.

&#x200B;

I wish Epic which powers the majority of games but also the Volume that is used in almost all new TV productions.... was public but they are private for now.

&#x200B;

**At the end of the day the stocks to pay attention to are:**

The Chips Needed to Make these: Intel, Nvidia, AMD

The Fabs that produce them: TSCM, Samsung, Intel

Then there are companies producing the software: Epic, Blender, Unity. Adobe

The Streaming Services: Netflix, Disney+, Max (Warner Bros) -- then you have youtube material being turned into its own streaming service like Curiositystream Inc.

The Companies that specialize in building AI  Model with datasets: OpenAI (Microsoft), Google, Facebook, ByteDance, etc.

Royalty Companies: Dolby, IMAX

**Then there are the host of startups creating custom chips for these tasks (ASICS), newer software, and existing VFX studios who know how to power them all. Which is where the money will be for future stocks.**"
AMD the buy of the week? ,"AMD is down roughly 15% as of right now. I currently just bought $2000 worth. It's possible it could go down further. However, I think it being down 15% is a good buy-in price. I think it is a better buy/value as of right now compared to Nvidia. This isn't me trashing Nvida still a good a stock just I believe AMD is a better buy as of this moment. Thoughts on this move? I might contribute more but undecided right now.  "
"I'm an astrophysicist and I perform my own (simple) stock analyses based on kinematic principles: comments welcome! (March 17, 2019)","Third post of the series! Thanks for everyone’s wonderful feedback so far and to the r/stocks moderators for their excellent support! This post reflects Friday's moves, and I am posting today (Sunday) in preparation for the upcoming trading week.

&#x200B;

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play.  My script runs a loop from 50 (previously 200) to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy.

&#x200B;

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Thanks to all of your feedback yesterday, I've made a few improvements since my last post:

&#x200B;

1. I cleaned up my source code for public consumption, which can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\_optimize\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)
2. Most importantly, backtesting! This has been a frequently asked question, and is without doubt an important undertaking. While more rigorous backtesting is always warranted, here’s what I have done so far: Taking SPY, DIA, and NDAQ as test cases, I ran a loop over the script (included as backtest.pro on github) and tested the predictions against the actual data. I examined mainly the directional accuracy (whether the price goes up or down), and used these to tune several of the parameters: namely how many derivatives to include in the projections, which max/min SMA periods to include, and how to optimally weight the outputs from different SMAs.Going back 1000 days and predicting 10 days into the future, this script was \*on average\* 61% correct at predicting the direction of change for SPY, DIA, and NDAQ. I think this is pretty decent, though of course far from perfect. Other sets of parameters that I tested typically yielded between 50-55% accuracy. For comparison, see [this](https://hackernoon.com/i-spent-20-minutes-trying-to-predict-the-stock-market-with-ai-these-are-my-results-59d48c7a388a) machine learning approach that generated excitement from the financial crowd with 54% accuracy.
3. I am now including a relative strength index (RSI) column in the table to help identify when a stock is overbought/oversold. A typical strategy is to consider RSI>70 to be overbought, and RSI<30 to be oversold. I try to maintain a portfolio of stocks between those values, although it’s possible for an RSI to remain over 70 (or below 30) for a significant period of time. Take any predictions for stocks with RSI>70 with extreme caution as they are likely to experience a reversal!
4. Based on the results of the backtesting, I have changed the maximum SMA from 200 to 50, and have included the third derivative in the price projections.

&#x200B;

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

Cheers!

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

Could NVDA go the way of Cisco?,"Yes, chips and AI aren't going away. But neither was the internet. People would make that argument about cisco at the dotcom. ""It's just the beginning"". 

At almost 95 p/e ratio, is it still sensible to buy?"
Time to sell NVDA?,I’ve seen the prices of this stock rise & fall in several cycles over the last 6.5 years. Im thinking I may be able to exit my position & get back in at roughly $100 sometime over the next 60 days. Thoughts?
FTC sues to block Nvidia acquisition of ARM,"[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/ftc-sues-to-block-nvidias-40-billion-acquisition-of-arm.html):

* “The proposed vertical deal would give one of the largest chip companies control over the computing technology and designs that rival firms rely on to develop their own competing chips,” the FTC said in an announcement.

* Nvidia stock was up over 2% on Thursday before the announcement, and did not move significantly on the news. The FTC complaint is not yet public.

* FTC Chair Lina Khan, who was appointed by President Joe Biden to lead the agency shortly after her confirmation to the agency earlier this year, has signaled an interest in more robust antitrust enforcement. 

* The trial before the FTC’s own administrative law judge is set to begin on Aug. 9, 2022.

This is [not wholly a surprise](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-latest-earnings-report-is-nail-in-coffin-for-40-billion-arm-deal-analyst-172042020.html) to people paying attention. Perhaps that's why price of NVDA didn't really move that much on the news (for now).

Any thoughts on the effect on NVDA? Would this tougher FTC enforcement affect other big acquisitions you're counting on for other companies? For example, when is AMD going to be done with Xylinx?"
First company to hit $10T valuation? ,"Just curious what others think about this. 

While I’m sure we’re at least a few years away from such a milestone, I could definitely see it happening by ~2032 assuming no WW3. 

My thoughts are that it’s really just a race between the top 5 or so companies. Nvidia, Google and Microsoft with Amazon and Apple being contenders as well. "
We went from FAANG to Mag7 to AI5...what will be the next stock grouping to lead the way?,"For a couple years FAANG was all anyone talked about with Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google.  Every CNBC broadcast mentioned the FAANG stocks.  Eventually that went away due to Facebook changing to Meta and the stock getting crushed, along with Netflix hurting.

Next came the Magnificient 7 aka Mag7, which has been Tesla, Nvidia, Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft.  Now with Tesla and Apple slowing, that has quickly ended.

Finally we've hit the new one called Ai5 of the top 5 AI stocks in MSFT, TSMC, Broadcom, Nvidia, AMD

So what comes next?"
MSFT GOOGL and AAPL are still all beating the market!,"5 year return on VTI is now 40%.

AAPL is currently 218% last 5 years.

MSFT is 155%

NVDA is 148%

GOOGL is 59%

Buying more as they fall!

Scooped up a little GOOGL at $84 today!

Waiting for AAPL $125

Waiting for MSFT $200

Waiting for NVDA $110

Let's go!

Good luck all!"
NVDA up 80% from yearly lows. What justifies such a radical price change?,"NVDA reached prices of $110 a share, and Reddit had completely lost faith in the company. Was this just an emotional response from gamers saying their new 4000 series GPUs were overpriced?

Where did this sudden spike in price originate from since October?"
"Here is a Market Recap for today Fri, Oct 9, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap  - Friday, October 9, 2020**

Stocks traded higher today as market participant’s closely monitor developments in a new virus-relief package amid mixed signals from top officials as to the size and scope of a proposal they might support.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) led the day, finishing the day 1.53% up. The S&P (SPY) finished 0.86% up and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.54% up.

Traders continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington weighing whether more stimulus will be passed, be it comprehensive or targeted. Despite Pres. Trump’s recent tweet saying he was not willing to negotiate further stimulus until the election, negotiations appear to continue. According to top officials and economic analysts, the passage of additional is key in encouraging and fast-tracking the recovery of the pandemic-stricken economy. 

According to multiple reports from CNBC, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and others, the White House is prepared to offer a new stimulus proposal totalling $1.8 trillion, about $400 billion below what the Democrats are asking for but an increase from the original $1.6 trillion offer. It's unclear what specific provisions will be included in the drafted legislation, but the earlier plan included a fresh round of $1,200 stimulus checks; expanded unemployment benefits at $400 per week and additional funding for state and local government. While a large gap still remains between the two proposals, let’s hope that the White House showing willingness to negotiate adds goodwill and Congress can come to an agreement. Today Trump tweeted “Covid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!”

Adding to the optimis, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Fox Business that the President “wants to do a deal.” This is a remarkable turnaround considering Pres. Trump’s recent tweet where he said he was not willing to negotiate an additional deal. The market has positively responded to this development.

Yesterday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin discussed further stimulus for about an hour. After the meeting Drew Hamill, Pelosi’s spokesperson, said in a tweet that Mnuching made clear the President’s interest in reaching an agreement for a comprehensive package after Pelosi made clear he would not support a standalone, targeted bill. In a note to clients Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist said, “A compromise on a big stimulus package in Washington could potentially deliver another October surprise, but the odds are against it as Election Day approaches.”

**Highlights**

* The Wall Street Journal reported that  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is in advanced talks to acquire Xilinx (XLNX) in a deal that could be valued at more than $30 billion. Shares of AMD were down more than 4% because of the dilutive effect the deal will have on the stock. XLNX was up 14.7% throughout the day.

AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for $4.9 billion in cash and stock,"Advanced Micro Devices on Monday said it plans to acquire server maker ZT Systems for $4.9 billion as the company seeks to expand its portfolio of artificial intelligence chips and hardware and battle Nvidia.

AMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.

The computing requirements for AI have dictated that tech companies string together thousands of chips in clusters to achieve the necessary amount of data crunching horsepower. Stringing together the vast numbers of chips has meant the makeup of whole server systems has become increasingly important, which is why AMD is acquiring ZT Systems.

“AI systems are our number one strategic priority,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an interview with Reuters.

The addition of ZT Systems engineers will allow AMD to more quickly test and roll out its latest AI graphics processing units (GPUs) at the scale cloud computing giants such as Microsoft require, Su said.

“The main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs,” Su said.

AMD plans to break off its server manufacturing business and sell it once the deal closes, as it has no plans to compete with companies such as Super Micro Computer, Su said.

AMD has not yet held talks with potential buyers.

ZT Systems Chief Executive Frank Zhang will join AMD and report to AMD’s data center chief, Forrest Norrod.

The closely held ZT Systems has roughly 2,500 employees of which AMD plans to retain about 1,000 engineers. Currently, ZT Systems generates annual revenue of roughly $10 billion, Su said.

Executives expect the deal to close in the first half of 2025 and expect an additional 12 to 18 months to sell the manufacturing business.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company’s developer conference in March that the one-time chip designer now creates and sells entire data centers, or the individual components needed to build one. This year analysts expect the company to generate $105.9 billion from its data center segment, which includes chips and other AI hardware. Su said last month the company expects to collect roughly $4.5 billion worth of AI chip revenue this year. The company’s customers include Microsoft and Meta Platforms.

AMD expects ZT Systems to contribute to the company’s adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

What to buy while waiting for NVDA pullback?,"I sold all my NVDA stock last week of February (due to written call options being executed at $785). Since I still strongly believe in NVDA long term, I plan to buy them back on the next pullback.. I just wont allow myself to sell low, buy high..

Since NVDA represented around 30% of my portfolio, I have quite a bunch of cash sidelined now.. What would you recommend to invest this in, given my plan to reinvest this amount in NVDA within the next year?"
Growth stocks-is it starting to feel like early 2021?,"Edit-early 2022.  

I understand no one has a crystal ball.  
I understand the market can remain irrational longer than I can remain solvent.  

Back in early 2021, it seemed like growth stocks could only go up, and even though stock prices were at irrationally high levels, I remember telling myself 'time in the market beats timing the market' ' literally the week before growth stocks took a 50% + beating and would trend down for a year.   

I recognise that I partially lucked out, selling my falling knives and buying back into companies like NVDA sub 150, meta sub 100 etc.   

Most of my investments were in an S&P500 tracker, which obviously had a much gentler fall.   

I currently hold £61k in individual stocks in an account I've sworn to not add money to, and £110k in S&P500 etf that I add £1-2k monthly.  

I'm 31 and still have my highest earning years ahead of me, as a surgeon. Were you in my position, would you just sell most of my Mag 7 positions + AMD and move it into SP500 etf?"
"DD for bb, Why I think BB would be a 200 billion company eventually","1, blackberry qnx RTOS had been installed on over 175 million cars globally, but this is not the recurring revenue and it is sold by licensing fee by piece. Among those 175 million legacy cars, about 5 dollars per licensing fee, that is the reason why BB stock price was so low in the past years.  

2, But with the blackberry gene of safety, security and mobility, of course with the Iso 26262 and safety highest level, link is following https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications,  qnx is embedded in Qualcomm and NVIDIA with long time partnership. So blackberry consolidate ability of the communication and computing, and control the first hand data generated inside the cars.

 Some guys don't believe qnx as OS is working on  nvidia, please Google It. It is official declaration in 2018.  Link is this https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform

3,  with those first hand data, blackberry is a emerging big data company, so the exclusive partnership with Amazon leads to the blackberry Ivy platform which will be provided to the carmakers based on a subscription monthly fee, and which would be 55 split between blackberry and Amazon. 

4,  why carmaker would need this blackberry Ivy platform? In coming future all carmakers will be a fleet of cars, all cars would be sold near costs and carmakers will survive from the subscription fee from the carowners. Link is here from the boss of the NVIDIA, https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/nvidia-ceo-says-software-will-soon-define-car-drive-profit

5, the recurring subscription fee from carmakers will be only a part of the recurring revenue for  blackberry, there is another recurring revenue from the cyber security section which is now wp. 29 (link follows https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/regulations/wp-29-vehicle-cybersecurity/),  and beyond that is  ISO/SAE 21434 which is a totally new still under draft, and cross standards of the connected cars. 

If someday Tesla declare that they will cooperate with blackberry, that is the necessary step from my view. 

Think further and look forward, all the automotive industry will be inspired and reinvented by Tesla, such as  by creating new business mode. 

But for the specific function of the car especially for the passenger use, it replys on the safety and security heavily which is a policy and regulation oriented, HUGE MOAT.

Saudi Arabia expects to get access to Nvidia's high performance chips 'within the next year',"Saudi Arabia is optimistic about gaining access to U.S. chipmaker Nvidia's high-performance chips, which would enable it to develop and operate the most advanced artificial intelligence models.

Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, a top official at the Saudi Data and AI Authority, Abdulrahman Tariq Habib, said the kingdom expected to make such a stride in the next year.


""I think within the next year,"" Habib, Deputy CEO of SDAIA's strategy management office, told CNBC's Dan Murphy after being asked about a potential timeline. It's a significant expectation given that the United States' strict export controls have thus far prevented the chips' export to the kingdom. Habib made the comments on the sidelines of GAIN, Saudi Arabia's international AI summit, which took place in Riyadh this week.

It ""will mean a lot"" for Saudi Arabia to have access to the chips, Habib said — in this case, the Nvidia H200s, the firm's most powerful chips, which are used in OpenAI's GPT-4o.

""It will ease business between Saudi and U.S.,"" he said. ""It will also open a lot of doors for building the capability, the computational capabilities, in the kingdom. But most importantly, it's not only the computational capability that's important. We worked hard in the past three years in building capacity, in human capacity, we also build data capacity as well. So we are working and collaborating with all [of the] international community and contributing [to] be one of the top active countries in data analysis.""


Saudi Arabia is pouring considerable investment into developing a robust AI ecosystem in the kingdom, disclosing in a report by SDAIA that it aims to have AI make up 12% of its gross domestic product by 2030. According to the report, published on Sept. 9, the kingdom's $925 billion Public Investment Fund will lead the investment.

NVDA SAYS AI CHIPS ON TRACK AMID FEARS,"https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/264989/Nvidia-says-AI-chip-on-track-amid-fears-over-flaws

Agencies and staff reporter

Nvidia said it was on track to ramp up production of its most advanced artificial intelligence chip, following reports of a delay in its launch due to design flaws.

Tech journal The Information had reported that design flaws on its new Blackwell chip could cause a delay of three months or more and the setback could affect customers such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft, which have collectively ordered tens of billions of US dollars' worth of chips.

The chip giant's Blackwell series succeeds its earlier flagship AI chip, the Grace Hopper Superchip.

In response, a Nvidia spokesman said ""Hopper demand is very strong, broad Blackwell sampling has started, and production is on track to ramp in the second half."""
"Intel stock jumps on plan to turn foundry unit into subsidiary, allow outside funding","Intel shares jumped almost 10% in extended trading on Monday after the company said it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital.

As part of CEO Pat Gelsinger’s effort to turn around the struggling chipmaker, Intel said in a memo to employees that it will also sell off part of its stake in Altera.

Gelsinger said the restructuring would allow Foundry to “evaluate independent sources of funding,” and comes days after Intel’s board met to assess the direction and future of the company. The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it for the last two years.

Beyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named to discuss confidential information.

With a standalone “operating board” and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully-integrated unit into a separate company.

Intel has lost almost 60% of its value this year, as the company has lost market share in its core PC and data center market and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads. Last month, Intel reported disappointing quarterly results, sparking the sharpest selloff in 50 years, and said it would lay off over 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.

Intel will also pause its fab efforts in Poland and Germany “by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand,” Gelsinger said. The chipmaker will also pull back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said.

The company is also roughly halfway towards the layoffs announced in August, Gelsinger said.

Intel also announced on Monday that it had entered into a deal with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips for AI.

The move is a vote of confidence in Intel’s quest to manufacture custom chips for companies in its foundry business, in addition to designing its own products.

It extends a long-running partnership between the two companies. Amazon is a large end customer of Intel chips to power its AWS servers, and will buy a custom Xeon processor from Intel as well, Intel said.

It also will allow Intel a new foothold in the growing industry for AI server chips. While Intel has several products that can be used for AI, including one called Gaudi 3, Nvidia has largely taken control of the market.

Amazon has developed its own AI chips, including one called Trainium, for over five years. Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have invested heavily in custom chips to run AI in hopes that theirs would be less expensive or offer other advantages over than Nvidia’s general-purpose GPUs.

The company said that the chips would be made on the company’s 18A process, which is expected to be used in production in 2025. Analysts expect the manufacturing technology to be similar to TSMC’s forthcoming 2nm process. (The first chips using TSMC’s 3nm process are shipping now in Apple’s iPhone.)

Intel said that it would perform its most advanced manufacturing, including the AI chip for AWS, at its plant in Ohio that’s currently under construction.

“All eyes will remain on us. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because that’s the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know we’re capable of achieving,” Gelsinger said.

Nvidia's stock gained 2% in premarket trade after HSBC analysts, including Frank Lee, raised the price target from $600 to $780 and maintained a Buy rating. They cited the ongoing AI boom as a key driver, expecting strong AI server momentum to surpass projections and continue outpacing supply. This trend is anticipated to persist through 2025, benefiting from a clearer understanding of US Cloud Service Providers' capital expenditures.  
  
The bullish outlook aligns with Nvidia's impressive 2023 growth, with its shares surging over 200% year-to-date. The success of AI solutions like ChatGPT has stimulated this growth and propelled Nvidia into the ranks of trillion-dollar companies, alongside Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia's upcoming fiscal Q2 2024 earnings report is highly anticipated after the company's optimistic guidance of $11 billion in revenue, a substantial leap from Wall Street's $7.15 billion estimate.

"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, Sept 28, 2021"," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, September 28, 2021**

Stocks sank today, as technology stocks plummeted, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) having its worst day since March as investors nervously eye a swift rise in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, a disappointing consumer confidence report, and power shortages in China that threaten the global supply chain as the busy Christmas season approaches, along with the evolving Evergrande situation. 

Market participants continue to diest development coming out of Washington.  Congress members continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent the government from defaulting and shutting down. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. Last night, Republicans refused to pass a bill to avert a government shutdown and raise or suspend the debt limit to prevent the US from defaulting on its debts. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would not provide the Republican votes necessary.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.54% at the time of writing, the highest level since June. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks, like technology, the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. While higher yields are generally seen as a bet on a strengthening economic environment, it does make it more expensive to borrow capital, which weighs heavily on growth stocks, which are valued heavily based on future earnings projections.

Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG Group, said “the prospect of higher energy prices, fueling inflation, and rises in bond yields appear to be pre-empting tighter monetary policy by central banks, have prompted widespread selling across global stock markets. Like yesterday, it is the highly-valued growth stocks that have taken the brunt of the selling, as investors fret that a lower growth, tighter policy environment will hurt these previous star performers.” 

According to a report by the Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, US consumer confidence fell to a seven-month low amid the surge in coronavirus Delta variant cases (which are finally starting to fall again), supply chain issues, and a slowdown in growth rates moving forward. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 109.3 this month from 115.2 in August, the third straight monthly decline. Lynne Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board said, “These back-to-back declines suggest consumers have grown more cautious and are likely to curtail spending going forward”.

In other news,  a series of power cuts and even blackouts across eastern China, where most of the population lives as demand threatens to outstrip the country’s electrical supply, adding a new threat to the already slowing economy and likely further snarling already disrupted global supply chains ahead of the busy Christmas season. This can already be seen in the sky-high charter rates for container ships, which have risen 10 out of the last 13 days and have more than quadrupled since the beginning of the pandemic.

There are several reasons why electricity is in short supply. As more regions in the world reopen from pandemic-induced lockdowns, demand has skyrocketed, forcing already electricity-hungry companies to use more power. Export demand for aluminum, steel, and concrete, three of the most energy-intensive products, has been very strong domestically and abroad. Moreover, as electricity demand rises, it has pushed the price of coal, which is the main way China generates electricity, higher.

TSMC second-quarter profit beats expectations as AI chip boom continues ,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday beat revenue and profit expectations in the second quarter, as demand for advanced chips used in AI applications continue to surge.

Here are TSMC’s second-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Revenue: 673.51 billion New Taiwan dollars ($20.82 billion), vs. NT$657.58 billion expected

Net income: NT$247.85 billion, vs. NT$238.8 billion LSEG SmartEstimate weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate

TSMC reported net revenue rose 40.1% from a year ago to NT$673.51 billion, while net income increased 36.3% from a year ago to NT$247.85 billion. The firm guided second-quarter revenue to be between $19.6 billion and $20.4 billion.

Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei in an earnings call on Thursday said business in the second quarter was supported by strong demand for its industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, though it was offset by continuous smartphone seasonality.

Explosive demand for AI has stretched chip supplies. TSMC is the world’s main producer of advanced chips found in everything from smartphones to AI applications, though rivals such as Samsung and Intel have been trying to challenge its dominance. It counts Apple and Nvidia among its clientele.

“I also try to reach the supply and demand balance, but I cannot. Today, the demand is so high I had to work very hard to meet customer demand,” Wei told analysts.

“The supply continues to be pretty tight, all the way through 2025,” Wei warned, adding that the firm hopes the tight supply can ease in 2026.

The chip giant currently produces 3-nanometer chips and plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025. Typically, a smaller nanometer size yields more powerful and efficient chips.

Development of 2-nanometer technology is “progressing well” and is on track for volume production in 2025, said TSMC. 

For the third quarter, the business is expected to be supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand, said Wei, adding that they continue to expect 2024 to be “a strong growth year for TSMC.”

TSMC projects third-quarter revenue between $22.4 billion and $23.2 billion. This compares to $17.3 billion in revenue posted in the same period a year ago.

For its capital budget this year, the firm is narrowing the range to between $30 billion and $32 billion, versus a previous forecast of $28 billion to $32 billion. Out of this budget, 70% to 80% will go toward advanced technologies.

“We are working very, very hard to get enough capacity to support customers,” Wei said.

The firm further added that it is not ruling out the possibility of converting more “N5” technology into “N3″ technology to meet the strong demand for 3-nanometer chips.

TSMC shares closed 2.43% lower on Thursday, as Asian chip stocks tumbled on the back of a U.S. tech sell-off sparked by reports that Washington is considering tighter export curbs.

Big AI demand

Surging demand for advanced chips used in AI applications has boosted TSMC’s Taiwan-listed shares by nearly 70% so far this year.

“The demand for generative AI is surging in the cloud and at the edge. TSMC’s N3 process boasts good yield rates and well-managed production lines. The market is well-funded, and regional political factors drive increased demand for advanced processes,” Brady Wang, associate director of Counterpoint Research, said on Friday ahead of the results.

Wang said the capacity of the 3-nanometer process is expected to more than double in 2024 compared to the previous year.

Needham analysts on Monday said they expect TSMC to raise its 2024 revenue growth target, reiterating a “buy” rating and raising the price target to $210 from $168 on the chip giant’s U.S.-listed shares.

“We expect TSMC to raise its 2024 revenue growth outlook from ‘low- to mid-20s’ to ‘mid- to high-20s’ but maintain its 2024 [capital expenditures] target at $30 billion on the upcoming earnings call,” Needham said in a note.

TSMC held 62% of global foundry market share in the first quarter, up from 59% in the same period a year ago, according to Counterpoint Research data.

Bear Case: Why I believe Alphabet will do everything right and still lose,"Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue.

With the ""Attention is all you need"" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch.

But even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift.

Much of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo.

Ultimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA."
Intel INTC selected as MSFT/OpenAI custom AI chip fab,"News came out at the same time as FOMC today and was lost in the shuffle a bit:

https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-expects-overtake-tsmc-making-fastest-chips-this-year-2024-02-21/?ref=upstract.com

Article also says its process will be ahead of TSMC at the time 2025.

Notable because of Altman saying he was looking for $7T for chips, most of which will presumably go to the manufacturer (Intel).

Happy NVDA ER day!"
AMD Delivers Upbeat Sales Forecast as It Shifts Into AI Chips,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave an upbeat revenue forecast for the current quarter, signaling that its new artificial intelligence processors are helping bolster growth.

Revenue will be roughly $6.7 billion in the third quarter, the chipmaker said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts estimated $6.62 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The outlook suggests that AMD is making headway in its pursuit of Nvidia Corp., which dominates the market for so-called AI accelerators — chips used to develop artificial intelligence models. Nvidia has capitalized on booming demand to send its shares and stock price soaring over the past year, becoming the world’s most valuable chipmaker in the process. Now AMD is looking to make inroads with its own lineup, called MI300.

AMD is Nvidia’s nearest rival in the market, but still trailing by a wide margin. The hope is to gain more of the money that data-center operators such as Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are pouring into the creation of AI tools.

AMD shares rose about 2% in extended trading following the announcement. They had earlier closed at $138.44 in New York, leaving them down 6.1% for the year.

AMD’s quarterly report kicks off a week of earnings updates from large semiconductor makers. Qualcomm Inc., Arm Holdings Plc and Intel Corp. all report numbers this week, and it comes at a delicate time for the chip industry. Investors have been selling shares of the companies after a dramatic run-up earlier this year.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: “Tesla is far ahead in self-driving cars”,"“Nvidia (NVDA) Chief Executive Jensen Huang talked up Tesla (TSLA) autonomous driving efforts on Wednesday, claiming the EV giant is ""far ahead"" on self-driving vehicles and that all cars will eventually have autonomous abilities. It also just so happens that Tesla’s FSD is powered by Nvdia’s chips. TSLA shares angled lower Thursday.

""Tesla is far ahead in self-driving cars but every single car someday will have to have autonomous capability,"" Huang told Yahoo Finance Wednesday night. 

""One of the things that's really revolutionary about version 12 of Tesla's full self-driving is that it's an end-to-end generative model,"" Huang added. ""It learns from watching videos — surround video — and it learns about how to drive end-to-end, and using generative AI, predict the path and how to understand and how to steer the car. So the technology is really revolutionary and the work that [Tesla’s] doing is incredible.""

My Take on Semiconductors - TSMC DD,"Reports of the [semiconductor shortage](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/538474-biden-to-sign-executive-order-addressing-chip-supply-chain-shortage) in early February had me take deeper look into the industry. Wanted to share my thoughts with the sub!

The market is essentially split into two parts. Companies like AMD, NVIDIA, and QCOM design chips. Companies like TSM, UMC, and Samsung produce them. The shortage here is exclusively on the production side. We can't make chips fast enough and many industries (car makers in particular) are complaining really loudly about the shortage. Some of this is self-inflicted and short-term. Automakers cut back production forecasts because of COVID and rely heavily on just-in-time production supply chains to cut back on costs. This means that they were largely caught with their pants down when demand started to pick back up. 

There are strong longer-term trends driving the shortage here too. Cars are getting more complicated and EVs need more/better hardware/chips. Right now, auto-makers are generally looking at 14nm chips ([Tesla's MCU2](https://onlyusedtesla.com/teslas-media-control-unit-mcu1-vs-mcu2/) is based on the Intel AtomE8000). This is an older process node, Intel was [releasing 14nm chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i5_processors#Skylake_microarchitecture_(6th_generation)) in 2015. I think ultimately, car production is going to have to be cut back, prices are going to go up, automakers are going to rush to lock in future supply, and producers (not designers) are going to benefit.

The producer market is really interesting. It takes a LONG time to spin up a new factory (fab). Generally speaking, it's 3-4 years before a factory goes from planning to production. We can't really throw money at this problem to fix this in the short-term. The producer market is also very clearly split into two parts: those who can make 10nm chips and below and those who can't. This [chart](https://s3.i-micronews.com/uploads/2021/03/ILLUS_HIGH-PERFORMANCE-PACKAGING_Overview_SemiconIndustry_YOLE_March2021.jpg) breaks it down at a high level. There are only three companies that can make chips that we'll want in the next 5 years (Intel, Samsung, TSMC), and one of them can't really do it. Intel has gotten 10nm reasonably figured [out but can't break 7.](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-announces-delay-to-7nm-processors-now-one-year-behind-expectations) They've given up the production race and [plan on outsourcing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/intel-talks-with-tsmc-samsung-to-outsource-some-chip-production) their future designs to TSMC and Samsung. 

Between Samsung and TSM, TSM is investing much more aggressively for the future. They've already planning on building out a 5nm production line in Arizona for [\~20K wafers](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/tsmc-increasing-spending-arizona-chip-factory-35b-2021-03-09/) which should increase their global production by 20%. There are [rumors](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-arizona-fab-potential-expansion) that they are expanding production to 100K wafers which would double their global 5nm capacity. Samsung is still figuring out [where they want to build](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16483/samsung-in-the-usa-a-17-billion-usd-fab-by-late-2023). It also looks like [TSM](https://www.pcgamer.com/tsmc-3nm-2021-apple-chips/) is going to beat [Samsung](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/samsung-beginning-3nm-chip-mass-production-2022-2020-11-19/) to 3nm by almost a full year. 

That said, the stock is not cheap. It's got a PE ratio of 53. But the steep technological moat, aggressive investment in future production, and long-term demand increases (cars/computers/phones aren't getting any simpler or less popular) makes me confident they'll grow into their price. 

TLDR: We need more chips. TSM makes the best chips."
AMD is a steal at $75,"\[Repost:Had to take out a youtube link\]

I have been a long-term investor in AMD and there was a lot of news to unpack in the last weeks as well as an election coming up today. I wanted to give my opinion on the current state of AMD and why at current levels this company is an incredible opportunity for the medium- to long-term investor.

&#x200B;

So three 3 major events happened in the last few weeks that I want to address:

&#x200B;

[**Q3 Earnings Report**](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4a33e72ea85fe760bd81d3f9e8b71721/amd/news/2020-10-27_AMD_Reports_Third_Quarter_2020_Financial_976.pdf)

First of all their Q3 results were above expectation again (same as in Q2). EPS = 0,41$ beating 0,36$ expectation and revenue = 2,80B beating 2,55B expectation. While keeping gross margins at 44%. Note two things here: first of all beating your expectation again in the current COVID pandemic. But also the exponential growth comparing to Q3 2019/Q2 2020. It indicates that AMD is really taking off. **Meanwhile their stock price is still at the same levels as after Q2 earnings (75$)**.

&#x200B;

**35B Xilinx Takeover**

Then there was one of the reasons why the stock price went lower, namely the Xilinx takeover. Since I am not familiar enough with Xilinx I will let the following articles explain why this deal is a good deal from a fundamental standpoint:

[AMD's 35B acquisition of Xilinx is another stroke of strategic brilliance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2020/10/28/amds-35-billion-acquisition-of-xilinx-is-another-stroke-of-strategic-brilliance/?sh=f76ffe71c9f8)

[AMD buys Xilinx, troubles mount for Intel](https://analyticsindiamag.com/amd-buys-xilinx-chip-intel-impact/)

Since this takeover is completely financed in stock, this has a downward effect on the stock price in the short-term. This is mainly because arbitrage traders buy Xilinx stock and sell AMD to take advantage of the price discrepancies. This means that the selling of AMD stock is not initiated from a valuation standpoint of AMD itself, hence there is a buying opportunity for the AMD shareholder. The main takeaway from this merger is, as Dr. Lisa Su puts it, the increase in **TAM: Total Available Market**. The takeover opens an array of markets; including automotive, aerospace and defence. Plainly said: more markets>more chips to sell> >more profits.

&#x200B;

**New GPU Reveal**

Then there was the revealing of their news 6000 Series graphics cards. As you can see in the presentation the new cards can go head to head with market leaders NVDA’s cards. This is a market where AMD performed poorly before. This means two things: a possibility to increase market share but more importantly: **their technology is enhancing so well they can even compete with NVDA in the GPU market.**

This has a lot to do with the fact that Dr. Lisa Su is an Electrical Engineer and **AMD (after the Xilinx merger) has 13,000 engineers under employment**. As Jim Cramer said: He stopped being an Intel hawk when they appointed a MBA as CEO

**RISK**

Of course there are still risks in investing in AMD as well. First off we have the (global) market risk, especially with the current election coming up. However, in the long-term both Biden or Trump won’t stop the semiconductor market from growing at a similar rate as it has been so far. The only risk is the geopolitical risk, because AMD heavily relies on TSMC (a Taiwanese company) for their production. But this is a segmented-market risk as well since NVDA and Apple also rely on TSMC. And with the current projection of Biden winning the election, hopefully US-China relations will improve in the near future. And hey, no risk no reward right?

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I’ve been a long-term investor in (mainly) two companies, the other one being ASML. I saw the potential of ASML getting a monopolistic position in the EUV technology and invested heavily in them when their stock was around 80-90 euro. ASML doesn’t have the same potential anymore as AMD has now. Especially since AMD is still trading at the same levels after their Q2 update. I shifted my portfolio more towards AMD, and I am suggesting you do the same.

&#x200B;

AMD: 3,000 shares, 6,500 LT Warrants."
I Analyzed $NVDA So You Don't Have To,"Hello everyone, Today I will be analyzing $NVDA otherwise known as Nvidia. I also have done analysis for other companies as well. Feel free to check them out on my profile! For those that don’t know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone!

During the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in the process of doing. For example NVDA discussed plans to build something which they call Earth-2, Earth-2 is an AI supercomputer which will be made specifically to predict climate change. Another cool thing they’re doing which I’m sure some of you have heard of is the Omniverse avatar, Omniverse is a technology platform which generates interactive AI avatars. The avatars that are created through this platform will be 3-D. According to NVDA they will be able to see and speak. The avatar will be able to talk about a very wide range of subjects. In the Automotive sector, They released AI technology which allows safe autonomous driving on streets and a computer architecture and sensor set made specifically for self-driving systems. I could go way more in depth on the other great advancements this company is doing but these were my favorite and I think you guys get the point.

Now let's talk about their evaluation…

1. Nvidia beat expectations, and they had pretty strong revenue growth in Q3, however, percentage wise, they did fall short compared to their semiconductor competitors, such as AMD and TSM. Their EBITDA margins are also looking pretty good. However, compared to other competitors in the space, once again they fall short, other companies in the space captured a larger portion of the market. Overall, Nvidia’s multiples are leading more than any other company.
2. Management believes that there is a lot more growth in store. They are growing at a tremendous rate right now. In the earnings call, The CEO of NVDA said that they are finally transitioning into becoming a software company. Nvidia is the dominant leader in creating GPU hardware and now they are also becoming a leader in AI tools and virtualization technology. NVDA wants “Every transaction that goes over the internet to touch a GPU” While also selling the best software available to utilize their GPU’s.
3. Nvidia's current market cap is very substantial. This stock has had extreme hype as of recently, especially because of the anticipation regarding the Omniverse. It’s definitely possible that this company could see great growth over the coming years. Especially since they basically have a monopoly on GPU hardware and also very extensive experience in visualization and AI, but they will be fighting a lot of competition from companies that want in on the action. Furthermore, Uk regulators have been pushing back on Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition of the chip designer Arm and if this transaction is hindered then it could put a pretty big crater in Nvidia's plans. Overall, I believe their company is very overvalued right now and people should wait for a dip if they want to buy into this company.

I hope you all learned something from my analysis of this company. Thanks for reading everyone!

"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, November 18, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 18, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed on Thursday, with Nasdaq (QQQ) massively outperforming on the day, driving by strength in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN) while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell for the second straight day. Market participants continue to digest the tail-end of a better-than-expected corporate earnings season amid a backdrop of rising inflation. 

Key Numbers For Today 

* S&P 500 (SPY): +0.34%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.04% 
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.13%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.41%
* Apple (AAPL): +2.9%
* Amazon (AMZN): +4.14%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): +8.25%
* Alibaba (BABA): -11.26%
* Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID): -16.4% and -10.47%

After a monster run-up last month, the choppiness in the market can be attributed to mixed economic reports coming out recently. While US retail sales came in better-than-expected, a great sign that consumer demand  is staying robust, the recent report on inflation showed the fastest pace of growth in roughly 30 years. 

Earlier in the week, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT), two of the largest retailers in the US, reported earnings. While the report was better than expected, executives from both companies raised concerns over rising prices, rising labor costs, and supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. 

The possible staying power of inflation remains the central focus for market participants, as a potential damper to consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP and as a catalyst for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than originally expected. Despite starting to taper the pace of quantitative easing, the Fed has remained very accommodative and says an interest rate hike could take place sometime near the middle of next year. It would be really bad for markets if the timeline is accelerated. 

Adding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. 

The Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:

* **Continuing claims, week ended November 5:** 2.080 million vs. 2.120 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.209 million during prior week

TSMC sales grow 45% in July on strong AI chip demand,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s revenue rose 45% in July, accelerating its pace of growth from the June quarter and bolstering hopes for sustained strong demand for artificial intelligence chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp.

Sales for the month reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts project TSMC revenue should grow 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July result suggesting TSMC may surpass those expectations.

Taiwan’s biggest company is one of the key bellwethers for AI demand, as the go-to chipmaker for leading accelerator makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the sole supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, at a time the mobile device market is showing signs of bouncing off post-Covid era lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook to beyond the maximum mid-20% it had guided toward previously.

TSMC offered an upbeat assessment of its business and prospects when it last reported earnings, with Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei signaling the company may have room to raise prices as more of its customers transition to its most advanced technology and have to compete for limited capacity. High-performance computing, led by AI, contributed 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, the first time it has accounted for more than half.

Still, investors have started to question whether the billions of dollars Big Tech firms have invested in the infrastructure to support the AI boom will result in substantial returns, while a potential delay in Nvidia’s development of a new generation of AI chips is spurring concerns over the progress of the emerging technology.

What Bloomberg Intelligence Says

TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, marking its second-highest sales gain in the past 20 months, aligned with our expectations for robust 3Q performance. This surge could indicate sustained, strong AI chip demand and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC is well positioned to beat the top end of its $23.2 billion 3Q sales guidance.

Worries about the global economic outlook over the past week interrupted the AI rally that had seen key players like TSMC gains billions in market value. Investors opted to cash out of some of the year’s biggest gainers, pushing TSMC’s shares down 10% in a day, though the company recovered much of that in subsequent days as money managers saw a good buying opportunity.

"META Still The Cheapest of The Magnificent 7, Am I Wrong?","Quick glance at some of the numbers for META. That EPS is crazy good, going back to the good times of 2021 all over again.

&#x200B;

|Market Cap|$1,193,404,268,544|
|:-|:-|
|Return on Assets|17%|
|Yield|0.43%|
|Beta (1Yr, Daily)|1.737|
|Gross Profit Margin (ttm)|80.8%|
|FCF to Equity|28.6%|
|Price to Sales|7.63|
|Price to Gross Profit|9.45|
|Price to Book|6.72|
|Basic EPS (ttm)|15.2|
|P/E|30.8|

&#x200B;

GOOG, MSFT, AAPL are trading at good prices, but META is a more attractive investment option, imo. AVGO is also another good option although not part of the Mag 7, yes or no?

AMZN, NVDA, and TSLA are excluded due to their high prices. Despite the sky high price, NVDA is a better pick compared to AMZN or TSLA, imo.

&#x200B;

These are my thoughts. What do you think? Love to hear your comments."
Made 30% since I started trading 7 months ago and all credits to r/stocks.,"Hello folks, 

I am a 24 year old who started working barely a year ago. What started as a small experiment with 3 AAPL stocks is now standing at over a 1100$ gain. This sub has always been the starting point for all my research. I come here to check what’s new, read the comments, then work backwards and start researching before I buy, sell or hold anything. 

I never wanted to hold long and the plan was to always swing trade on a company during its earnings. Gradually, I started making educated choices, became confident and started holding, did not panic sell but doubled down whenever the market dropped and here I am. From shares pricing in the future effects to investors moving towards Gold at times of nuclear threat and towards bonds when their yield increases; this sub has taught me a lot. 

The gains might not last long but I am glad I made it till here. I just wanted to thank you all. You guys are awesome. 

Portfolio:
AAPL - got in at 152, 164
NVDA - got in at 154, sold at 200, got in at 200 
SHOP - got in at 80, doubled down during the Citron dip
NFLX - got in around 160 and sold at 240 (regret big time)
TWTR - got in at 19 and sold at 21
SQ- got in at 37
AMD - got in at 11 and out at 13.5
 
I have decided to stay in the game long and I am now waiting for the next dip to invest in,
V
NFLX
BABA
AMZN

Let me know what you guys think. I know that my portfolio is completely tech and diversification is something I should do. I could not help it since I love those products I have invested in and think they can do well in the long run. Also, I regularly keep track of the tech industry news than others. 


Edit: YES. It is a bull market. Anyone could have made money. My whole point was that, I started making decisions based on the sub. I could have still made money but not 30 percent. Let 30 percent be a stupid value which anyone could have made. I am happy I did and felt thankful to this sub. That is all. Seriously guys!"
CNBC: Meta’s advertising growth is proof that hefty AI spending is already paying off,"This is a pretty long article, but I think it is an important read since it answers the key question ""Is anyone making significant money from AI right now?"" Clearly the answer is yes for Meta. 

For easier reading I tried to bold the parts the discuss AI specifically.

Source: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/meta-advertising-growth-proof-that-hefty-ai-spending-is-paying-off.html)

For investors who are skeptical of Meta’s massive spending on artificial intelligence and whether it will pay off anytime soon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is urging them to look to the present.

After the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Zuckerberg and finance chief Susan Li rattled off all the ways that AI has helped the company grow faster than the competition in the digital advertising market, Meta’s core business.

“The ways that it’s **improving recommendations and helping people find better content**, as well as making the advertising experiences more effective, I think **there’s a lot of upside there**,” Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. “Those are already **products that are at scale**. The AI work that we’re doing is going to improve that.”

Meta reported revenue growth of **22% from a year earlier to $39.07 billion**, with 98% of its sales coming from advertising, primarily on Facebook and Instagram. Its growth rate was double that of Google’s ad business, which saw sales increase 11% to $64.6 billion, Alphabet
 said in its earnings report last week.

Meanwhile, Pinterest and Spotify, which are both significantly smaller than Meta, reported revenue growth of 21% and 20%, respectively, in their latest reports.

As in previous quarters, Li said Meta’s advertising business benefited from online commerce, gaming and the media and entertainment sectors, and that ad growth continued to be strongest in the Asia-Pacific region. She said the company’s “improved ad performance” helped lift overall ad prices despite slowing growth in that region.

Zuckerberg pointed to **AI as the foundation behind Meta’s refreshed online advertising platform**, which was battered after Apple introduced an iOS privacy update in 2021 that made it harder for social media companies to target users across the Internet.

“They rebuilt their ad tech stack using AI and they changed their user interface and **generated a lot more user engagement because of AI**,” said Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, in an interview on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Wednesday. “It’s **showing up in the revenue and the profits now**,” said Mahaney, who recommends buying Meta shares.

Meta shares popped 7% in extended trading after Wednesday’s earnings report, which included an uplifting forecast for the current quarter.

Like the other mega-cap tech companies, Meta is **spending billions of dollars** on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), which are needed to train AI models and run hefty workloads. Some industry experts have questioned the outlays because so much of the investment is tied to expectations that generative AI — popularized by OpenAI’s ChatGPT — will lead to big revenue gains in the future.

‘Already seen a return’ Meta is showing that, while the bet is on major growth down the road, the company is **reaping rewards today**.

“You’ve already seen a return with Meta over the last two years,” Mahaney said.

Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, agreed with Mahaney, telling CNBC that Meta has “really navigated some of the concerns and the storms” from a couple years ago and is “**clearly integrating AI across their ecosystem extremely nicely**.”

Zino noted that Meta’s growth rates are “**nicely outpacing those of its peers**.”

**Meta isn’t finished spending big money on AI** and the far-flung metaverse, which continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter. Li said that Meta expects “**significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research** and our product development efforts.”

For 2024, Meta said it now expects capital expenditures in the range of **$37 billion to $40 billion, lifting the low end of that range, which had been $35 billion**.

Li says investors should think of Meta’s AI strategy as a two-pronged approach, with “core AI” helping Meta improve its advertising platform and recommendation system, thus leading to more user engagement and ad performance that “have translated into revenue gains.”

Generative AI is a longer-term bet. Li said that the company doesn’t “expect our Gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in ’24, but we do expect that they’re going to **open up new revenue opportunities over time** that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”"
